The systems may need additional modification to work more efficiently.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners were able to identify the source of the transmission inside the system, the toxic world §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!.

  ### Everchanging ###

  code_final_digsite:0 "Reality Code - $ehof_the_sphere_named$"
  code_final_digsite_desc:0 "Finding a way into $ehof_the_sphere$ seems like an impossible task. Stimulating or Penetrating the surface with radiation or mechanical force may be futile, just like with the amplifiers.\n\nThe surface may possess no defined temperature as a whole, but the separate components of the surface themselves do. Their temperatures probably range in the orders of extremely low and extremely high temperatures.\n\nEvery form of equipment that would be used to even only touch the surface, would probably be destroyed in an instant. Instead, our researchers want to go with the approach of using the $ehof_epcs$. It was the key to get access to the amplifiers and the $PGATE_GALACTICS$, so it may be the key for $ehof_the_sphere$ as well. However, they will not just use any enigmatic pattern code sequence, but the master-code sequence. It is likely that, if the $ehof_the_sphere$ even reacts to the $ehof_epcs$ at all, it will be to the master-code sequence.\n\nDue to the immense size of $ehof_the_sphere$, a single transmitter will probably not be enough for it, in case that it might truly react to the $ehof_ep$. However, only one facility will be constructed to begin with. It will be a directional transmitter for the $ehof_epcs$ and emit the $ehof_ep$ onto the surface via gravielectromagnetic waves.\n\nConstruction of the facility can begin now."
