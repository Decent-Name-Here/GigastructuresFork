  district_maginot_ringworld_planetary_cannons_desc:0 "Outfitting our ringworld with massive weapons batteries makes it quite capable of shredding any vessel in low orbit - ensuring starship captains stay well out of any firing envelopes. As such the cannons are mainly prepared for interception duties against enemy ordnance and dropships. Vast command and control complexes interface with near-space strategic defence systems, allowing deployment of greater numbers of platforms, as well as strengthening existing ones."

  district_maginot_ringworld_bunkers_desc:0 "Bunkers and heavy anti-ground weaponry as far as the eye can see, extending even to the curving lands overhead. This section of the ringworld is not outfitted with a conventional surface, making for a broken landscape with many sheer drops seemingly into deep space. Camouflaged gun emplacements are ready to rain hell on enemy forces, their overlapping fields of fire covering every cubic meter of volume. Extensive training facilities ensure our troops are prepared for any contingency, and drills are constantly held on all sorts of terrain, including near-space and boarding operations."
