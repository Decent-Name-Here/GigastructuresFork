  TITAN_LANCE_AETERNUM_DESC:0 "A colossal energy beam of focused quantum fields, further enhanced by the addition of psionic energy embedded within the fields, creating a formidable weapon capable of simply erasing most targets it comes across."
  LASER_AETERNUM:0 "Aeternite Loop-Quantum Projectobreaker"
  LASER_AETERNUM_DESC:0 "An Aeternite-designed Quantum Projector, focused towards destroying the armor of large enemy vessels by employing entangled Loop-Quantum energy fields enhanced with slight amounts of psionic potential."

  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_3_DESC:0 "Further improvements now enable us to safely pack copious quantities antimatter into the superheated slag being accelerated by the artillery, tremendously increasing its destructive potential."
  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_4:0 "Lunar Relativistic Artillery"
  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_4_DESC:0 "Even more powerful and complex railgun apparatuses means the continent-sized cloud of superheated antimatter-filled slag can be accelerated to speeds getting dangerously close to the speed of light."
  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_5:0 "Lunar Singularity Artillery"
  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_5_DESC:0 "Advances in field and gravity manipulation have drastically increased the effective density of the artillery's projectiles to physics-defying limits, meaning even more slag can be fit into artillery and said slag is significantly deadlier."
  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_6:0 "Lunar Planck Artillery"
  GIGA_MOON_ARTILLERY_6_DESC:0 "Field manipulation enables the artillery to hyperheat its shells to near the highest possible temperature in the universe. Combined with their near-impossible density, these revolutionary shells can and will destroy anything they come across."

  ### BLOKKAT WEAPONS ###

  LASER_BLOKKAT:0 "Planck-Dismantlement Beam"
  LASER_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "The Planck-Dismantlement Beam is a Blokkat device based on their stripmining apparatuses. Not only do these devices systematically dismantle the very fabric of enemy ships down to the subplanck level, reducing them to a slurry of hypercondensed quantum foam, they also collect said foam and store it aboard Blokkat vessels, where it can later be reprocessed into usable materials."

  BLACKHOLE_BLOKKAT:0 "Tetradimensional Singularity Cannon"
  BLACKHOLE_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "These advanced launchers catapult a seeking four-dimensional singularity towards enemy ships. While they appear detached from Blokkat ships, these singularities are actually more akin to \"lassos\", as they are connected to Blokkat vessels through a higher dimension and are later \"reeled back\" by said vessels through this higher dimension after plowing through enemy ships. This enables the Blokkats to collect whatever the singularities destroyed and process it for later usage." 

  PLASMA_BLOKKAT:0 "Absolute Scorch Blaster"
  PLASMA_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "The Absolute Scorch Blaster fires a glob of plasma heated to the Planck Temperature, which is practically the highest possible temperature under known models of physics. The plasma is kept to these extreme temperatures by a constant influx of energy through a higher dimension and matter which comes in contact with the plasma is \"absorbed\" into said dimension, converted into energy in a way similar to how Blokkats harvest star systems and then fueled back into the plasma to further sustain the projectile's heat."

  ARC_EMITTER_BLOKKAT:0 "Pentafocused Emitter"
  ARC_EMITTER_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "The Pentafocused emitter is a titanic piercing weapon of Blokkat design, which is capable of \"leaping\" through a higher dimension in order to bypass the shielding and armor of energy vessels."

  STRIKE_CRAFT_HANGAR_BLOKKAT:0 "Blokk-Swarmer Units"
  STRIKE_CRAFT_HANGAR_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "These spaceborne units heavily resemble actual Blokkats themselves and are geared for spaceship combat. They are most often remotely controlled by Blokkats within the mothership and are even sometimes Blokkats."

  POINT_DEFENCE_BLOKKAT:0 "Blokk-Guardian"
  POINT_DEFENCE_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "These hyperefficient point-defence systems shatter the very fabric of reality around enemy projectiles, obliterating them before they even get close to Blokkat vessels."

  OBLITERATOR_LANCE_BLOKKAT:0 "Obliterator Ray"
  OBLITERATOR_LANCE_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "In essence an upscaled version of the Evictor Ray, the Obliterator Ray tears reality asunder and forcefully compresses its target into a 0-dimensional object by focusing the energies of several higher dimensions onto a localized area of the spacetime continuum, destroying it instantly."

  PLANET_LANCE_BLOKKAT:0 "Evictor Ray"
  PLANET_LANCE_BLOKKAT_DESC:0 "The Evictor Ray is the largest Blokkat weapon encountered so far. This beam of untold power tears reality asunder and forcefully compresses its target into a 0-dimensional object by focusing the energies of several higher dimensions onto a localized area of the spacetime continuum, destroying it instantly."

  PLANET_KILLER_BLOKKAT_GENERATOR:0 "Hypermatter Dismantler"

  GIGA_MAGINOT_DEFENCE_DRONE_SWARM_DESC:0 "A swarm of drones linked to their host $name_maginot_world$, they require no crew, onboard shield generators, or independent command cores, and can thus operate more effectively in combat than free-flying strike craft of similar size."
