  resolution_public_recognition_of_solakia_desc:0 "The Roqualian Republic is one of the many Flusionian nations which fell victim to the Kaiser's asinine tide of rampant militarism.

The Laurnaise possessed dangerously powerful weaponry capable of rivalling or even surpassing that of the Kaiser but were unable to resist the Katzenarmee due to their unfortunately unstable government.\n\nThe Kaiser uses Laurandar as his main propaganda center, thus by officially lending our support to the Laurnaise rebels, recognizing their independence, and funding them, we can help them work with the Roqualian Freedom Fighters and break the Katzen propaganda machine. This would have a significant impact on the organization of Katzen armed forces who would also have to deal with bolstered Laurnaise resistance thanks to our support." 
  resolution_public_recognition_of_laurandar_success:0 "This will increase §YPartisan Activity§! by §Y2§! in §YLaurendaar§! and §YGeschwollen§!.\n\nWill §Rdecrease§! the §YKaiser's Opinion§! of everyone in the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] by §Y2§!.\n\nRaiding Katzen Warehouses will grant twice as many §BResistance Resources§!.\n\nWill §Rreduce§! the stats of Katzen ground forces."

  resolution_cooperative_intel_gathering_success:0 "Passing this resolution will grant §G3§! $aeternum_tech_intel$ to everyone in the galaxy after §Y5 years§!.\n\nDuring those 5 years, we will have to spend §Y150§! £energy£ per month in order to sustain the program."

Aeternum is effectively the \"Fallen Empire of the Fallen Empires\" and thus it is reasonable to assume that even the mighty precursors might feel threatened by the Aeternites. It is only logical to at least try and extend invitations to these ancient civilisations and perhaps get them to join our alliance."
