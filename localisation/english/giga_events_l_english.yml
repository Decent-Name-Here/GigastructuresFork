  # The shroud contacts you to give you the tech
  giga_psychic_beacon.008.desc:0 "During a routine and otherwise unremarkable telepathic session, something that is shocking in its mundanity reveals itself. An opening, buried in the ethereal mist, looks suspiciously like a fragment of real space, albeit well illuminated by what appears to be a light source in the distance. Our telepaths trying to ascertain whether this is a mere vision, or truly a haven of sanity in the bowels of the Shroud are interrupted as a formless entity makes its presence felt.\n\n"I'm a mere Navigator" it says, "one of many."\n\nWith that, an understanding is reached. The entity resigns itself to a patient silence, barely able to conceal its childish excitement and curiosity."

  ehof_cause:0 "§HCause§!\nDue to the uncertainty principle, in every fraction of a second, countless quantum fluctuations of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs emerge everywhere in space. These fluctuations stimulate minuscule volumes of space and create the foamy, microcosmic structure of space known as quantum foam. Virtual micro black holes which only exist for an immensely short period of time can emerge in this quantum foam. These black holes can turn into real $ehof_wormhole$ via quantum tunneling and their lifetime is much longer than that of the micro black holes, but still extremely short. They can potentially be stabilized and inflated by the The Arcane Rift Manipulator for instantaneous space travel."

  ehof_effect:0 "§HEffect§!\nThe highest density of quantum fluctuations can be found inside the ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which is a property of essentially all black holes. There, where the space is already twisted so immensely by the enormous rotational and gravitational forces of the black hole, the hawking radiation that is responsible for the decay of black holes, increases the quantum fluctuations even further. The quantum foam structure of space is so intensely stimulated in these volumes, that the number of emerging micro black holes is many magnitudes larger than in average space and thus the number of $ehof_wormholes$ which can be inflated."

The fields serve as enormous immaterial tweezers for the inflation process and also keep the $ehof_wormholes$ open.\n\nIn order to increase the stability of the $ehof_wormholes$, the $ehof_ehofp2$ is equipped with negative pressure application plates, which apply negative pressure to the event horizon while a $ehof_wormhole$ is being inflated. The negative pressure increases the security of the inflation process.

Highly advanced hardlight construct projectors and sterile hyper-neutrino detectors increase the security and efficiency of the $ehof_wormholes$ inflation mechanism to 100%. The hardlight construct projectors replace the squeezed, condensed electromagnetic field projectors and support the Arcane Rift Manipulator in the stabilization process. The sterile hyper-neutrino detectors will allow the E.H.O.F Omega to determine the target of a $ehof_wormhole$ before it even gets inflated, which allows us to traverse to any type of celestial object.\n\nThe exotic $ehof_qnm$ further stabilizes the inflated $ehof_wormholes$ and fully prevents collapse. For this reason, $ehof_qnm$ injectors have been integrated into the $ehof_ehofp3$ to inject $ehof_qnm$ into the event horizon.\nThe probabilistic target routines for the $ehof_ehofp3$ targeting mechanisms include:\n  - §ERandomized Destinations§!\n  - $ehof_category_01$\n  - $ehof_category_02$\n  - $ehof_category_03$\n  - $ehof_category_04$\n  - $ehof_category_05$\n  - $ehof_category_06$\n  - $ehof_category_07$"

It makes use of ultra fast reacting tachyon sensors, which replace the sterile hyper-neutrino detectors and are much more efficient at determining a $ehof_wormhole$'s destination, actually so efficient, that we can choose any particular stellar system within our galaxy. \n\nJust like the $ehof_ehofp3$, the $ehof_ehofp4$ utilizes negative mass injection and now through our knowledge yielded from $ehof_the_sphere_named$, we were able to develop Electroweak Quasi-Field Materialization and restore the Arcane Rift Manipulator. Electroweak Quasi-Fields and the restored Arcane Rift Manipulator will, in unison, be able to not just inflate and stabilize $ehof_wormhole$ perfectly, but also keep them open indefinitely, as long as we desire. \n\nThe $ehof_ehofp4$ is truly the perfect form of the $ehof_ehof$ and the pinnacle of interstellar travel!"

We have detected a number of deactivated Quberine-manufacturing plants within the ringworld, which might start producing Quberine again if we restore this ringworlds power supply during future repairs.\n\nThe research teams have also concluded that the small station above the star serves as a sort of 'central access point' to the Squareworld's internal systems. They encourage us to spend some energy credits and alloys to repair and subsequently re-activate it, as it might grant us to access invaluable data about the Squareworld and its builders stored within its vast internal archives.

However, the Katzens were busy fighting an unexpected war against external invaders known as the Lappinbots which sprung up after the project started, making the whole endeavor tremendously expensive to their civilization. Although the terraforming structure was remarkably well-made, its sheer cost led to an economic collapse. Because of this, the Sobakis of Nienet, a civilization which shared the Gatzo system and were once close allies to the Katzens, decided to strike at Katzenland, in an attempt to conquer it while it was weakened, contradicting our original theory that the Katzens struck first.\n\nMeopa then retaliated with the 'fury of a thousand suns', completely and utterly devastating Nienet's surface. This disproportionate genocidal response led to a drastic drop in the nation's stability, which culminated with empire-wide revolts against Meopa's regime. Meopa, unwilling to step down, and his sanity rapidly deteriorating, proceeded to do the unthinkable:\nHe unleashed the rest of Katzen nuclear arsenal... upon Katzenland itself. He destroyed his own world, killing billions of Katzens and Zuspri. The relatively small Katzen space empire then collapsed, with the few colonies unable to sustain themselves without their capital.\n\nAlthough, the records spoke of a large colonization vessel labelled the §YMeopian Expedition 1§!, launched prior to the Sobaki-Katzen war towards an unknown faraway planet, which carried both Katzens and Zuspris in cryosleep, meaning there is a slim chance the species are still out there, somewhere.\n\nOn the bright side, we have managed to recover surprisingly intact and detailed schematics of Projekt Katzenform, which will undoubtedly benefit our knowledge of terraforming."

In a fraction of a second, the beam simply stops before it can even enter Paluushia's atmosphere, halted by an immensely powerful flow of pure psionic energy. The beam then dissipates into nothingness, and the Paluush casually returns to the surface, after effortlessly stopping a planet-destroying weapon.\n\nMinutes following this incident, a message echoes within the consciousnesses of the Colossus' crew:\n§RWas the message not clear enough?

  giga_flusionunion.011.desc:0 "We have received news that the §YUnited Flusionian States§! are in upheaval, as radical elements of Flusionian society have recently undertaken a drastic political scheme to topple the established government!\n\nThe rebels originated from the nation of §YLaurandar§!, one of Flusion's former nations that merged with the supranational UFS in order to counter §YKaiser Kattail§!'s attempt at taking over the planet prior to them achieving FTL. While the emergency of the situation ensured Laurnaise compliance, now that the Kaiser has been gone for over a decade, the more extreme elements of former Laurnaise society have longed for a return of their nation as an independent state.\n\nNaturally, this was practically impossible, as the entire planet had already been federated into the UFS, and its president, §YDofus§!, was unwilling to allow his hyperstate to crumble. As such, the political leaders of Laurandar had been slowly gathering support amongst their old population, and through cunning charisma, they even managed to rally the Kaiser's former citizens to their cause by promising them a future of \"galactic conquest\".\n\nAnd thus, millions and millions of Laurnaise and Katzen partisans petitioned for an emergency election to replace Dofus, who eventually conceded after several years of rising tensions. Naturally, the former ruler of Laurandar, §YAaron N. Bleu§!, ended up winning said elections by a wide margin.\n\nHe then proceeded to immediately abolish the UFS's former constitution and ordered his loyal supporters and military to seize control of anything opposing his rule. It only took a few weeks for the Laurnaise to completely take control of the UFS, and Aaron has now proclaimed the birth of the §YLaurnaise Empire§!, an authoritarian and militaristic state bound on galactic domination.\n\nAnd thus, as quickly as it came following the Kaiser's defeat, Flusionian democracy has once again perished, perhaps this time for good."

And yet, the Kaiser still seemed to elude them. They were about to give up, when something usually not so remarkable happened.\n\nA device usually used to detect cosmic rays picked up something: A lone exotic particle, which seemed to act in a way not predicted by our current models of physics. Furthermore, the particle apparently came from none other than the Katown pyramid, the former seat of the Katzen government.\n\nOur scientists proceeded to follow said particle backwards, tracing back its trajectory through the Pyramid. After going through the Pyramid's labyrinthine corridors, they eventually ended up within the Kaiser's former office itself.\n\nAlthough the office didn't contain anything of particular interest at first glance, indeed, something was emitting exotic particles not normally found within our universe. That something appears to be a sort of nanoscopic rift located about a meter or so above the floor, a miniscule artificial tear within spacetime itself. It indicates that something, or rather, §Ysomeone§!, recently punctured through the fabric of reality. Evidently, everything points towards the Kaiser having teleported out of Flusion, most likely to somewhere else in the galaxy.\n\nOur science team is now in the process of setting up a research facility near this small, yet pervasive rift, in order to study it and possibly use it to trace where the Kaiser ended up.

It is however very likely that this bouncing is simply a side effect of the rift being partially dissipated and thus improperly connected to the Kaiser's destination.

This effectively means the Kaiser has time-travelled, and further study of the tunnel reveals he most likely went forwards in time.\n\nThey are uncertain as to just how far this tunnel goes, although they estimate it most likely doesn't go beyond a few hundred years into the future. Anything further would undoubtedly have impossibly high energy costs, at least for a civilization like the Katzens.\n\nThey are now preparing a craft capable of going into the rift and \"opening up\" the temporal tunnel as it goes, which should allow us to go just as far as the Kaiser, and subsequently find him.\n\nWe have also made several interesting discoveries by studying how particles interacted with this temporal tear."

These rebels adamantly defend their ancestral ways of life and cultures, and staunchly oppose the Kaiser's attempts at integrating them into Katzen society.\n\nWe have managed to identify two somewhat significant resistance networks within the Imperium: the §YRoqualian Freedom Fighters§!, made up of citizens from a nation formerly known as §YRoqualia§!; as well as the §YZuspri Vanguard§!, comprised of §YZuspris§! from the former §YZuspri Intermarium§! on Flusion.\n\nAlthough their members are few and far between, and currently pose little problem to the Kaiser, we have determined that secretly contacting either of them could potentially help us in our struggle to finally end the Katzen threat.\n\n§BResistance will be an invaluable asset to weaken the Katzenartig Imperium!"

We used to reside within the §YZuspri Intermarium§! on §YFlusion§!, where most of us lived an idyllic hunter-gatherer life.\n\nWe are usually organized into great clans of varying sizes, spread across our land. §YGuides§!, the most experienced and wise of Zuspris, exerted control over the individuals of a clan. And I, well, served as a sort of 'Great Guide', exerting some authority over every clan and Guide in our nation. We did have cities and settlements, but they never had more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants.\n\nIn this position, I mostly let the Guides do whatever they deem right, as I believe they should be allowed to live their lives however they want, and they are the best when it comes to deciding what's right for their clan.\n\nThis decentralized form of leadership is how we have lived on Flusion for millennia. We never really had ambitions to expand beyond our borders, as living off the land was sufficient for the vast majority of our population. It was a good life.\n\nUntil the Kaiser arrived, that is."

Our great lands were filled with massive forests, vast marshes, and imposing mountain ranges which my kind called home.\n\nDespite our seemingly primitive ways-of-life, we nonetheless assembled a vast train network, which spanned the entire empire and connected most major settlements. It was our pride, in a way.\n\nThe Intermarium was split between a myriad of these Guides, who exerted their rule over numerous Zuspris. And we simply... lived our lives, enjoying ourselves and exploring what our nation had to offer.\n\nIt wasn't always perfect, but at least we weren't oppressing anyone or starting wars everywhere."

  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserbad.response:0 "The Kaiser... §Yvisible sadness§!... is a wretched fool!\n\nWhen he first initiated §YProjekt Mondkanone§!, we didn't pay much attention. Some clever Zuspris went to work on the project, but my kind did not care that much.\n\nThen, everything changed when the §YKatzenartig Imperium§! attacked.\n\nThe Kaiser utilized the Mondkanone to bombard our lands from orbit, destroying our §YWhirlwind Cannons§! which we had constructed to pierce through Katzen armor. Katzen ships fired clusters of torpedoes which obliterated our coastal defences.\n\nBut we didn't surrender! They had yet to roll their panzers into our land, and we were confident that our hunters would shred their metallic beasts with ease. Plus, our harsh terrain of mountains, forests and marshes made actual military operations extremely complicated for them.\n\nThat's when the Kaiser did the unthinkable, and... employed my own species, against us. The Katzens had, using our DNA as a base, bio-engineered a special breed of small, ravenous flying Zuspris! The wretched felines proceeded to release millions of them over our land, and we couldn't do anything.\n\nThese creatures were small, fast, nimble, and contained highly-corrosive acid which they spread everywhere upon death. These... malicious pixies chewed through our defences and allowed Katzen infantry to occupy our entire nation without firing a shot.\n\nOur Intermarium had fallen, and I fled, refusing to submit to Katzen imperialism. I have been attempting to coordinate Zuspri resistance ever since, but it never really went anywhere... until now."

  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserverybad:0 "What did the Kaiser do with your land?"
  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserverybad.response:0 "Dreadful things...\n\nHe started by heavily industrializing our fertile plains, drained lakes and marshes, and even levelled some of our mountains to harvest more minerals.\n\nMy kind was forced into the Katzen military machine, and although the Katzens didn't openly oppress or shoot us, they still conscripted a large chunk of our population and began to slowly yet steadily erase our culture and beliefs, replacing them with their cult of the Kaiser and militarism.\n\nBut we Zuspris don't fold so easily! Although we had to obey, we still long for the day when the Kaiser is finally evicted from existence. Deep down, we all wish to return to our once idyllic lifestyle.\n\nIt's what feels natural and right to us. All this Katzen militarism, interstellar colonization, and expansion simply doesn't click with the vast majority of us.\n\nMy kind has a long lifespan, too, so most of the Zuspris that were around during the Kaiser's conquest of the empire are actually still alive, waiting for a chance to strike back. I do not want to let them down."

  giga_katrebels.0018.whatkaiser.response:0 "The most megalomaniac being in existence, that's who!\n\nHe only seeks to expand, conquer, expand, and conquer some more. I am not too sure of his motives, but it appears he simply wants to rule to... everything. It was Flusion at first, and if we don't do anything, it'll be the galaxy!\n\nNothing seems sacred to him, and he'll happily pave over our ancestral pastures to build more military factories. Well, he does try to make compromises at times, granting some species limited self-rule, but these compromises are obviously made to silence protesters and give him more time to indoctrinate them.\n\nAnd the Katzens follow him like some sort of deity, obeying his every word and going off to die in wars he started just because he felt like it. He indoctrinates every species he conquers, forcing them into his cult of personality and rampant militarism.\n\nI am not even actually certain where he came from, it seems he just sort of appeared on Flusion one day, and took control of the Katzenartig Imperium during a period of crisis. He's pretty mysterious... and annoying."

  giga_flusionoperations.7000.desc:0 "Eliminating the Großadmiral of the Kaiserliche Marine is no easy task, especially considering the increased security he will have since we assassinated Loris Von Kattensbach.\n\nOur first and cheapest option would be to simply send an assassin to shoot him, while this could work it would be hard to pull off as Meolson is rarely seen outside of his office in the heavily guarded government district of §YNeu-Pawsterdam§! except for when he is in his office in §YKM. Festungskomplex Südflusionien§! alongside other top admirals and a formidable Katzen garrison. Another more covert idea would be to poison him, but this would likely face the same issues our gunman plan would face.\n\nAnother more extreme idea would be to simply blow up the §YHaus der Bundesregierung§!, his home and office where he governs Katzeninsel. Like with blowing the §YBundeshalle§! this operation would severely disrupt the administration of the island but would also come with the side effect of severely affecting our reputation in the region as a a large percentage of the islands population lives in §YNeu-Pawsterdam§! and detonating a nuke in the center of the hyper-dense mega-city will cause significant unrest in the region and resentment towards the §YRoqualian Freedom Fighters§!.\n\nGoing along with the idea of blowing the Großadmiral up, we could spend even more resources in a riskier operation to blow up the head office of the §YKaiserliche Marine§! in §YKM. Festungskomplex Südflusionien§! and take out not just Meolson but a good portion of the Kaiser's top brass as well! It will also disrupt the training of new naval recruits for a few months. As a bonus, the complex's location on the smaller §YKätzchenInsel§! meaning the only civilians living on the island are families of military personnel who live on base, as such there would be a much lesser impact on the region than if we detonated the §YHaus der Bundesregierung§!.\n\nFinally, at the request of §YDofus Tequenik Machina§!, we could attempt to kidnap §YMeolson§! and take him into our custody. §YDofus§! has asked us to do this due to the friendly relations Roqualia and Flusion enjoyed with the former §YBundeskanzler§! before he was \"forced by the Kaiser into joining the imperium\".

Upon sending a small miniaturized probe through this hole, they realized that it led to... nothing.\n\nIndeed, this hole punches straight through the rest of the Birch World's shell, and leads directly to the vacuum right above the supermassive black hole! From there, what little water comes through immediately falls into the singularity and turns into new and exciting forms of matter before ultimately disappearing into the event horizon.\n\nWhile originally confused about the purpose of this hole, they then realized that it was hastily and artificially drilled through the Birch World's shell long after the creation of the reservoir itself. By analyzing the roughness of the hole itself, they deduced that another civilization on the Birch World, or perhaps some dastardly explorers, saw this reservoir as an opportunity to unveil what lied beneath the Birch World's colossal crust without having to dig through hundred of kilometers of nanoalloys beforehand.\n\nWhoever did this subsequently drilled a small hole through the seafloor with relatively primitive tools compared to what Aeternum had, and either them or their equipment most likely ended up falling to their doom into the singularity.\n\nThe actual purpose of the reservoir is unclear, but our expedition believes it might have simply been a place where Aeternum stored large amounts of water for future projects, which they evidently never realized.\n\nOur team estimates that it will take roughly 374 million years for the reservoir to completely drain into the black hole, and while this hasn't revealed anything of particular interest, studying the water falling into the black hole nonetheless yielded small amounts of physics research."

Revealed to our tachyonic instruments by the fact light and space curve significantly when in proximity to the object, its exact nature is currently unknown but it appears to be highly energetic, most likely a rogue microquasar passing through our local group.\n\nInterestingly, it is emitting recurring patterns of electromagnetic radiation, cohesive with the rapid rotation of a massive and active celestial body. Perhaps the most intriguing part is that the object appears to be moving faster than light, but the intense curvature of spacetime surrounding it precludes accurate velocity measurements.\n\nFurther observations will be conducted, but it seems unlikely to be anything of major interest."

After standing still for a couple of hours, it then instantaneously sped back up to its original speed in yet another physics-defying move.\n\nAdding to the initial shock of this seemingly-impossible occurrence, revised trajectory calculations have shown that, assuming it doesn't suddenly change its trajectory again, this intergalactic bolide is now on a §Rdirect collision course with our galaxy§!.\n\nA myriad of theories have sprung up to explain how and why it altered its trajectory so suddenly, ranging from a \"natural FTL drive\" made out of a Black Hole-White Hole pair feeding into one another, to the idea it might be a rogue quasar travelling on a sort of \"intergalactic hyperlane\", often theorized in studies pertaining to the plausibility of intergalactic travel.\n\nRegardless of the object's actual nature, it is currently just about a §Ymillion lightyears§! away from us and updated velocity measurements estimate it to be moving at roughly one hundred thousand times the speed of light, meaning we should expect to meet with this intergalactic visitor within this decade.\n\nA §YSpecial Project§! has been established to keep track of it."

No conclusive answer was found to this mystery, but further analysis of the data has led to our scientists attempting to trace back the object's trajectory through space before its sudden change in course.\n\nThey found that, when taking in account the movement of galaxies throughout the universe, the object's past trajectory lines up perfectly with the location of the missing galaxy."

And just like some expected and many more feared, it is indeed a colossal spaceship. Or rather and possibly quite alarmingly, a sort of gigantic intergalactic fleet.\n\nIt seems to consist of a humongous central vessel, resembling a triple ringworld arranged around an artificial black hole-like singularity, surrounded by several large crafts themselves escorted by an array of smaller vessels.\n\nThe purpose of these vessels is not yet known and their esoteric designs forbid us from properly understanding their intentions.\n\nRegardless, it appears whoever is manning the vessels has transmitted a powerful subspace signal to the entire galaxy, as a way of presumably "introducing" themselves to us."

Each of these beings possesses complete free will, but they are regardless connected to one another by a colossal information network hosted within a higher dimension and connects all Blokkats together. This effectively enables the instantaneous transfer of data from one Blokkat to another regardless of distance.\n\nFurther study of this information network, which is apparently dubbed the §YBlokkwork§! by the Blokkats themselves, has worryingly revealed that the Blokkats in our galaxy are actually an extremely small part of the complete Blokkat civilisation, who apparently operates multiple of such mothership's in various parts of the universe. While the exact number has not been determined accurately, it is likely to be well over at least §Rten thousand§!.\n\nThe Blokkats' actual goal is not yet clear, but their transmissions indicate the harvested matter from all mothership's is sent back towards an unknown central location.\n\nIt is quite evident that our galaxy is not the first one to be targeted by their harvesting fleets and it is unknown just how many civilizations have fallen victim to the Blokkats. Widespread Blokkwork archives notably mention the destruction of an intergalactic biological hivemind by Blokkat fleets, leaving the hivemind's scattered remnants to flee through the universe.\n\nOur scientists believe we might be able to further \"crack\" the highly-encrypted §YBlokkwork§! and retrieve more $blokkat_knowledge$ if we invest sufficient research into it."

This theory is further supported a study of the data relayed by those Blokkats to their brethren through the §YBlokkwork§!.\n\nBut these visits have conjured up a somewhat insane-sounding idea within our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§!: What if we could §Rcapture§! them?

Others were constantly patrolling the planet as if supervising the whole operation.\n\nThe Paluushes did not seem to notice or care about our expeditions, which navigated through the entranced crowds and towards a colossal spire-like building near the planet's northern hemisphere.

  # Grand Archives

  giga_blokkat.3314.name:0 "Initial Arrival"
  giga_blokkat.3314.desc:0 "Our science team has begun the arduous process of mapping out the colossal §YGrand Archives§!. Where at first our scientists expected to find the typical holo libraries, they were instead greeted with a sprawling underground cave network which doubled as a catacombs and a physical museum, carved with psychic power and designed for the stature of the Paluushians.\n\nThey are a highly reverent race when it comes to their history. It seems the Paluush are stunningly long-lived, with any one of them surviving for potentially thousands of years, giving the earliest of these creatures an opportunity to live until proper record-keeping was invented. The earliest mention of the Blokkats is from one of such accounts dating back approximately 11,000 years, told in the form of oral tradition and steeped in myth. Ancient Paluushians describe a silver palace, wreathed in flames, being cast from the heavens. There emerged a small race of yellow-bodied creatures.\n\nThere are murals depicting these Blokkats and they look nothing like the advanced automaton harvesting whole galaxies today. Instead they're a biological race, painted by the Paluushians to look like small, wicked demons, then referred to as 'Chablokks'. When the palace fell, an entire Paluushian village was wiped out in the calamitous impact, a dark cloud is said to rise up and hide the sun, and the fires surrounding the vessel lingered for days. A sort of Paluushian scripture accuses the Blokkats as being the origin of sin, and describes them as diseased to be unable to speak their hearts from their bodies.\n\nTo understand this, we turned to our sociologists, who found that the entire Paluushian society had evolved with powerful psionic abilities. This permitted the Paluushians to speak telepathically and sense one another's emotions, which we believe must have contributed to their cooperative, idyllic lifestyle, and must have made it difficult to lie to one another. The Blokkats, who were not psionic, apparently attempted to mislead the Paluushians numerous times.\n\nRegardless, after a series of thefts, land incursions, and small, violent skirmishes, the Paluushians grew to outrage after the murder of a highly revered shaman known as §YButterpoopsie§!. They mobilized for war, intent to drive the Blokkats out for good. The Paluushians seem to view this as something of a purification for the Blokkats, destroying their sick bodies and releasing them.\n\nThe Blokkats were armed with weapons we place at roughly the fusion era. Several of the Paluushian corpses are peppered with scorch marks and evidence of energy weaponry passing clear through bone. The Paluushians were meanwhile only armed at first with primitive spears - granted, these are spears standing stories taller than a fully grown §Y[ROOT.owner.GetSpeciesName]§!, and murals show them being hurled through Blokkat fortifications like great siege weapons, but all the same, at a glance it appears the Paluushians were at a severe disadvantage.\n\nThe death of a single Paluushian is viewed by them as a tragedy, having lost hundreds if not thousands of years of experience and knowledge all at once. The death of several is a slaughter. The Paluushians describe a terrible slaughter, and they begin to panic. Meanwhile, their most powerful asset, the Grandbunny, is in the midst of her §YGrand Slumber§! and cannot help."

  giga_blokkat.3315.name:0 "The Sparks of War"
  giga_blokkat.3315.desc:0 "From this point on, we observe Paluushian technology advance rapidly. At first the Paluushians were forced to flee the onslaught of Blokkat warriors, ceding tremendous amounts of territory. The Blokkats pursued them like vicious hounds, eventually becoming over-extended, at which point they resorted to punitive air raids on Paluushian villages. However, this led the Paluushians to a valuable insight.\n\nPaluushian psionic abilities had provided them with a vague sort of clairvoyance. It mainly gave them a sense of foreboding for difficult crop years, but this clairvoyant reaction became more sharply attenuated in these times of hardship. The Paluushians began to focus on these abilities, using them at first to predict Blokkat attacks so as to safely evacuate their civilians, then, gradually, to predict the results of their own military actions. This limited future sight led the Paluushians to launch a cunning series of ambushes on the Blokkat supply lines. They captured Blokkat engineers and psionically interrogated them to better understand the Blokkat weapons.\n\nThe Paluushian warriors were few in number, but made up for this with their enormity. Even with limited manufacturing - much of which was done by hand at great leviathan forges - they were able to craft new armors and rugged versions of Blokkat tank cannons, which were carried as standard infantry rifles. Since each of these weapons and suits were individually crafted, many are enshrined in the Archive, garnished with legends and given lofty names and titles to commemorate their service. Our own engineers regard these pieces as valuable to us even now, providing some grounded insight into early Blokkat weapons development.\n\nThe Paluushians launched a blistering-counter offensive. Able to predict the vague results of each battle, the Paluushians harried Blokkat supply lines, defeating them in protracted sieges. The Blokkats lost several important mining operations, ensuring the Paluushians would have raw materials to endure their battle for the coming years, and all efforts to retake the facilities were routed. Blokkat leadership appears to be at a loss during this period, unable to account for the sudden and inexplicable rise in Paluushian competence.\n\nThis era finally draws to a stalemate as the Blokkats consolidate their forces. The Paluushians, able to always be where the enemy would strike next, still lacked the manpower to fully defend much more than half the planet. Neither was able to make further advances, so both sides settled into an uneasy period of ceasefire punctuated by dangerous, tinderbox scuffles, during which time the Paluushians used Blokkat captives to better understand precision technology and refine their own industrial production methods.\n\nThough a far cry from modern Blokkat technology, it appears the Blokkats were already experimenting with a personal information network at this point. Our engineers inform us that some of the fundamental software architecture is still being used in modern Blokkat systems. While this seems incredible, our scientists remind us that a society composed of artificial intelligence relies on backwards compatibility for its continued survival. No one hopes to die from a bricked OS update. We have gained §Y1§! $blokkat_knowledge$ from our research endeavors."

  giga_blokkat.3316.name:0 "A Grand Conflict"
  giga_blokkat.3316.desc:0 "For a great length of time, the Blokkats and Paluushians appear to enter a sort of cold war. The Paluushians continued to hone not only their future sight, but also to apply new technologies weaponizing their psionic abilities. They grew less dependent on conventional supply and maintenance and developed into self-sufficient war engines capable of overwhelming a superior number of Blokkat combined arms using merely a thought.\n\nThis physical manifestation of psionic abilities appears to be a eureka moment for the Blokkats, who now had concrete proof that the Paluushians were operating on a playing field outside their perception. To compensate, the Blokkats began working on highly complex predictive algorithms in order to analyze and anticipate Paluushian war efforts. The software became quite competent, and unfortunately predicted that the Paluushian capacity for psionic advancement would soon exceed the Blokkat's resources unless they could expand their foundry operations.\n\nActing in fear of this revelation, there were several, terrible, large-scale battles between the two races as the Blokkats tried and failed to gain ground against their adversaries. Paluushian clairvoyance continued to prove the more efficient of the competing systems, and the loss of life with nothing to show rapidly grew politically sour among the Blokkat populace. Their government turned more authoritarian, cracking down viciously on dissent. The Paluushians, already long enemies, became the scapegoat for each and every issue facing the Blokkat leadership at the time. When a Blokkat slipped and fell, so it was, their government said, the psychic assault of a Paluushian.\n\nThe Blokkats then turned their eyes towards space. The development in this field seems rapid, and our scientists suspect it must have been aided heavily by their learning technology. In very little time, their capabilities were comparable to those of an early space-faring civilization, and yet they chose not to abandon Paluushia. Evidently, their predictive warfare systems suggested that any attempt to conduct a full-scale withdrawal from the planet would leave them vulnerable to Paluushian forces, resulting in unacceptable loss of life, so they instead directed their space mining operations towards reinforcing their planetary defenses. The Paluushians, meanwhile, became very effective at obliterating orbital satellites and deflecting orbital fire.\n\nHoping that space travel would be the silver bullet to defeat the Paluushian menace, the Blokkats made numerous efforts to deploy orbital weaponry that would overcome Paluushian defenses. Of great note, several of these weapons attempted to predict Paluushian predictions, then effectively attempted to mislead their clairvoyance to strike undefended portions of their territory. These programs did work on occasion, but the details are extremely technical and the Paluushians can offer no explanation as to how. To fight this development, the Paluushians adopted a policy to destroy any orbital station above the planet, proactively eliminating the threat before it could fire.\n\nA variety of these wrecked, experimental, orbital weapons are present in the Archive, and our engineers are delighted to report that some of the novel payload delivery methods could be applied to our own energy weapons!"

  giga_blokkat.33161.desc:0 "Centuries pass in the archives, and our researchers complain of difficulty parsing useful information from the overwhelming quantities of simply petty record-keeping. The two sides continued to fight with both words and weapons. The Blokkats developed an efficiency-obsessed autocracy whose culture practically revolved around overcoming the Paluushians. Countless books, television shows, and even children's cartoons all depict the Paluushians as the primary antagonists.\n\nThere is an entire decade of Blokkat soap operas featuring, as a central story, an evil Paluushian luring a Blokkat away from his friends, only to use him to steal state secrets - this fad appears to be related to an actual political scandal of the time where a sitting official was fired for aiding the Paluushians by misappropriating state resources. A typo caused the incident to be reported as the Blokkat word for \"cavorting\" with the enemy, rather than \"aiding\", and this seems to have captured the Blokkat collective imaginations. The Paluushians maintain extensive records on these soap operas, as well as biting commentary on them from Paluushian politicians.\n\nHowever, one Paluushian seer by the name of §YBumble§! regards these broadcasts with bemusement and suggests putting the \"war\" into \"culture war\". He has limited public interactions for some time, then re-emerges with a set of psychic weaponry that embed his power into sound waves. Going by the stage name of \"Big Bumble Top\", in honor of his stupendously voluminous hair, he broadcasts a torrent of music which is unwittingly intercepted by Blokkat critics. These critics then fall under the sway of his lyrics, denouncing the Blokkat government as they spread the material among their peers.\n\nThe Blokkats are completely blindsided by this and find themselves facing a cultural revolution out of nowhere. Officials are quick to connect the Paluushian music to the problem, but only by pure chance do they discover its effects can be negated by getting a second, \"more catchy\" tune stuck in the victim's mind. What follows is an absolute flurry of sound, where the Blokkats offer massive financial incentives to anyone who can make a more engaging song than Bumble, with Bumble constantly releasing new hit singles in an effort to surpass himself.\n\nThrough a combination of locking down their own broadcast networks, quarantines, and some of the most soulful music the Blokkats likely ever produced, they eventually manage to regain control and establish new regulations surrounding their cultural industries. From that point on, Blokkat entertainment is treated as utilitarian and potentially dangerous. Listening to or possessing any form of non-licensed entertainment media becomes a felony.\n\nOur lead archeologist, having listened to many of Bumble's works, is curious if it would be possible to get an autograph, but we suspect the seer is currently indisposed."

And §YNienet§! entered their own stellar war, and these less developed empires looked upon the Paluushians and Blokkats as a source of potential aid. Paluushian and Blokkat prediction models both stated the other side would get involved, and with the rhythm of a tragedy they entered the conflict.\n\nThe Blokkats are used mainly as a source of advanced machine trade, while the Paluushians are paid fortunes to lend the experience of any of their decorated heroes. Most Paluushians regard the work as a necessary chore, but one Paluushian by the name of §YSparkbun§! appears to treat the excursions as a sort of self-finding vacation. He remarks that over the many long years of stalemate, it's been difficult to truly understand the scope of Paluushian progress, but in this war his might cannot be opposed. It seems to be an eye-opening moment for him, and when he returns home he makes many passionate speeches about the future potential of Paluushia.\n\nThe war between Katzenland and Nienet dragged on. Their planets suffering, the two sides met to discuss a potential armistice. Dignitaries from the Blokkat and Paluushian empires were both invited to offer input using their legendary future-seeing abilities. The Blokkats counseled a cease-fire, but the Paluushian dignitary, a seer by the name of §YPoh'tin§! foresaw that this would lead to economic hardship, and more importantly to his own nation, an era of exploitative trade in benefit of the Blokkats.\n\nPoh'tin proclaimed that the only satisfactory way to resolve the conflict was a complete and total victory over one side. Poh'tin had envisioned this as a successful war effort guided by Paluushian heroes, leveraged into a hegemony thereafter. Sadly, it appears the two empires at stake took this in a far grimmer fashion. Not long after the fragile peace had set in, both Katzenland and Nienet were obliterated in a nuclear cataclysm, and the Paluushians on the planets were lost.\n\nJust as Sparkbun had been impressed upon by the war, Poh'tin walked away from this disaster questioning his role. Amid Sparkbun's calls to greatness, Poh'tin began to question the basic practicality of the Paluushian seer system. He argued their clairvoyance was now so wound up in predicting futures that their empire would never realize, that it was possible they were overlooking basic common-sense and simple deductive reasoning.\n\nThe Paluushians would get the chance to test his doubts when their seers foresaw an ominous military threat. Poh'tin argued that this foe was likely capable of reason, and if the Paluushians prepared for diplomacy and co-existence, there was a chance of peace. His words proved deeply unpopular among the embittered Paluushians, and he was cast aside in favor of Sparkbun's call to arms.\n\nThe invading force was an empire of genocidal machines known as \"§YRabbots§!\", which were not interested, if even capable, of coexistence. They attacked the Blokkat communication networks and disrupted their power grids, while the Paluushian psychic infrastructure was beyond their understanding. The Blokkats buckled, and were forced into a bloody, mass-exodus from the planet. The Paluushians carried on, their morale now skyrocketed, until the Rabbots were in ruins, vindicating Sparkbun while leaving the credibility of Poh'tin in shambles.\n\nYet, though the Blokkats fled the planet here, this isn't where the records on the Blokkats end."

  giga_blokkat.3318.name:0 "New Beginnings"
  giga_blokkat.3318.desc:0 "In spite of their exodus, the Paluushians never lost sight of the Blokkats. They tracked the Blokkats to a new planet, dubbed \"§YBlokatina§!\". The Blokkats, having suffered a tremendous loss of life, were now faced with the logistical nightmare of caring for a colony expedition that had only as much as they could pack into their ships before escaping. To solve the issue, they turned extensively to synthetic robotics and began wholesale rebuilding their population from the ground up.\n\nAside from manufacturing brand new beings to fill labor shortages, anyone too ill or injured to carry on with their old bodies had their minds transferred to new, mechanical ones. Within decades, the entire surface of Blokatina was converted into an ecumenopolis. They resumed their interstellar harvesting operations, but were now free to focus their efforts wherever they deemed fit rather than towards an eons long war. The speed at which they rebounded came as some concern to the Paluushians.\n\nThe Paluushians had likewise used their breathing space to expand, outwards across the system of Gatzo and beyond. However, as their race spread out, their psychic connection to one another weakened. Arcane technologies aided in the broadcast of telepathy, but these machines could be flipped on and off. The Paluushians had always maintained a close-knit tribal relationship with one another, but now tribes became more insular and political.\n\nThe earliest period of expansion met with very little infighting, but as the Paluushians reached the extent of their logistical capabilities of the time, Sparkbun began to raise the issue of the surviving Blokkats. The clairvoyance instruments were predicting some far-off calamity related to them, but the portents were so distant that no one seer could say with any certainty what the danger could be.\n\nSparkbun expressed his felicitations for the sprawling new borders of Paluushia, and reminded everyone that this seasonable frontier had only become truly available thanks to the Blokkats being driven from their homes. This good fortune was threatened, he argued, by allowing the Blokkats to rebuild, for soon they would position themselves as rivals to the Paluushians once again. The looming threat could be nothing else.\n\nThese fears resonated with many in the council and the civilians at home, but there were others who dreaded entering another perpetual war. Poh'tin once again raised his postulate about the fallibility of prophecy, and this time, for political convenience if nothing else, several of Poh'tin's peers accepted his argument and took up his cause. The council of seers was not able to arrive at a conclusion, but the plurality of delegates fell on the side of Sparkbun.\n\nAgainst protests from their political opposites, Sparkbun's enclave began constructing leviathan warships. The Blokkat defeat on Paluushia was an act of providence, Sparkbun declared, but the coming attack on Blokatina would be a right of all Paluushian peoples. A reckoning engineered by those most harmed by the Blokkats' evils, for only they could know the true width and breadth of Blokkat crimes, and only they would know the true sweetness of a peace borne by their destruction."

  giga_blokkat.3319.name:0 "Stellar Revenge"
  giga_blokkat.3319.desc:0 "It seems that Sparkbun didn't mobilize his forces entirely without incident. As the largest of the warships were being constructed, a seer by the name of §YTrevor§! began to complain that his people would have the war materials better spent on domestic projects. Trevor was in charge of an external colony which, up until this point, had been somewhat neglected in terms of modern infrastructure. His tribesmen were unhappy with having to deliver what little they had towards war machines, and donating their population to crew these massive ships left their towns bereft of educated specialists.\n\nSparkbun argued that these measures would not be necessary if and when the rest of the council came to their senses, but such a blame-laying excuse did nothing to solve the problems facing Trevor's people. Trevor bided his time as long as possible, but as the trust of his own tribe began to erode away from him, he had no choice but to back out of the war. Trevor ordered his work crew to withdraw, but Sparkbun was furious and had them blockaded.\n\nTo make it clear there was no choice in the matter, Sparkbun placed Trevor under house arrest on board Trevor's warship, \"The Wonderful and Adorable Kitty Who Tenaciously Hangs In There\". Sparkbun made clear that Trevor's tribe would receive adequate compensation as soon as fleet construction was ended and resources were free, but all the same, word reached the ears of the enclave who had supported Poh'tin. Poh'tin regarded this detention of a fellow leader as a criminal outrage, but action failed to materialize, and once preparations were complete, the ships departed.\n\nSparkbun appeared in Blokatina's system without warning nor formal declaration. His fleet's weapons powered on, and the Blokkats were struck before they could retaliate. The first volley, fired by a contingent of Paluushia's more conventional warships, buffeted the planet with a sickly rainbow of psychic power which seems to have torn the very essence from the organic Blokkats below. Their bodies vegetated, this act somehow rendering them all helpless and braindead.\n\nWhat followed was the weaponry Sparkbun had prepared specifically for the occasion. Once it completed charging, it began to compress Blokatina's star to approximately one tenth its initial size. At this point, the entire fleet escaped the system using a method similar to warp drives, and the star rapidly expanded, becoming a supernova. The death of this star would take several days to reach Blokatina itself, but the destruction was complete.\n\nTo his victims, Sparkbun broadcast only the following message:\n\n§Y\"The Paluush do not break. Merely, we bend. What comes is a striking recoil.\"§!\n\nThe return home was a somber one. The Paluushians had expected a fight, and their records have little insight into what the Blokkats must have been thinking at the time, or whether they were expecting this. It does seem that many shuttles escaped Blokatina before the planet's death, but Paluushian records seem certain that all organic life within the system had been eradicated. The Blokkats as they had appeared when they landed on Paluushia were simply no more.\n\nFrom all that we've learned, we've obtained another §Y1§! $blokkat_knowledge$"

  giga_blokkat.3320.name:0 "Neoblokatina"
  giga_blokkat.3320.desc:0 "When Sparkbun returned, he found himself greeted by a much smaller contingent of warships led by Poh'tin. Poh'tin demanded that Sparkbun stand down and resign from his position of leadership. He had derelicted his duty as seer, failed to commune with Trevor's people, and waged a one-sided war of genocide in which there was neither dignity nor glory. These demands were a bluff. If Sparkbun refused, it would mean a civil war, and one that Poh'tin was sure to lose, but the Paluushians had long held the belief that their race was incapable of political schism.\n\nYet here they stood. And this absolute deviation from convention and tradition was fortunately enough to provoke negotiations. Sparkbun refused to stand down, indicating he had the support of the greater portion of the council in the warships beside him. Poh'tin pointed out that Sparkbun was willing to detain council members, so any word they had in the matter was suspect in the best of cases.\n\nThe impasse stalled on, with seers litigating the matter back and forth. Trevor's people had been compensated as promised, but Sparkbun's actions couldn't be allowed to stand as a matter of precedent, lest they feel permitted at all. The bickering dragged on long enough that Sparkbun's council began to discuss the actual possibility of attacking their own kinsmen.\n\nThen, with a sense of dramatic serendipity for which the Paluushians find her famous, the Grandbunny awoke with a psychic yawn that rippled across all of Gatzo. She apparently needed very little formal explanation for the goings on of the past years, connecting herself instantly to every Paluushian in the empire. She forced them together once again, bringing them to understand each other's minds and hearts, their trials and pains. No longer could the Paluushians use the great distance of space to conveniently avoid communing with one another. The Grandbunny had bridged all gaps.\n\nAs simply as that, the Paluushians began to dismantle their empire and returned, in pieces at a time, back to Paluushia where they had always lived and always would live.\n\nIn the meantime, scouts were dispatched to follow up on the ultimate fate of the Blokkats. It seemed that though the organic Blokkats were no more, their synthetic citizens had begun rebuilding an artificial ringworld in Blokatina's system, converting the wreckage into a livable home that no longer relied on a functioning natural star. They called their new home §YNeoblokatina§!.\n\nThe Blokkats were all but helpless at this point. Some of their vessels were captured for study, and the synth bodies piloting them distantly resemble the Blokkats we recognize today. The chassis from this time period appear to be made of whatever the Blokkats could get a hold of. They simply repurposed the scrap and wreckage of the system directly into whatever they needed.\n\nBy studying these old designs, we've been granted §Y1§! $blokkat_knowledge$."

It seems that as the Paluushians made their return to Paluushia, they neglected their heavy industry, intent as they were to return to their idyllic lives under the watch of the Grandbunny. The Blokkats were meanwhile sweeping up behind them.\n\nInstead of colonizing the Paluushian worlds, the Blokkats simply scooped factory parts up and returned them to Neoblokatina, expanding the ringworld out, adding more wings, more rings - ever expanding manufacturing to feed their manufacturing. It must have appeared to the Blokkats that fortunes were finally turning in their favor for the first time since departing Paluushia, and had they taken merely these gifts alone, all may have been well.\n\nAs the Paluushians began to demilitarize their great war fleets, they must have seemed too juicy a target to the Blokkats. We cannot say what they were thinking for sure. Perhaps the Blokkats believed the Paluushians were suffering some massive disaster. Regardless, they used their salvaged foundries to produce a war fleet and rallied it towards Paluushia.\n\nBased on observation, it seems that part of the Blokkat fleet involved a precursor to the harvesting technology they possess today. They were intent on breaking down, and then reclaiming the Paluushian civilization. Sadly for them, until this moment, they had never met the actual Grandbunny. In the Blokkats' old media broadcasts, she had always been depicted as a backwards and ridiculous god the Paluushians believed in; a clownish figure who did not exist.\n\nWhen the Blokkat fleets arrived over Paluushia, they were proven woefully wrong. The Grandbunny's actions are definitely fatal, but our researchers have difficulty describing it. This is exacerbated by the psionic archives imprinting the sense of having actually been there. To quote the lead archeologist:\n\n\"Well, she raises up her hands, and the Blokkat fleets start flying backwards, right? And then I guess they sort of… turn inside out, so they're flying right-ways again. And then there's this thing with a scrum worm. Do you know what a scrum worm is? Neither do I. But what it is, it's definitely a scrum worm. You just know. Definitely a scrum worm. And this. Well, it - it's rather hard to explain, but it sort of... - it - it scrums, see?\"\n\nAnd apparently this destroyed the fleet in such a horrific fashion that those Blokkats just outside the \"scrum\" event made an emergency escape from the battle. Shortly thereafter, the Blokkats complete the astounding engineering feat of building gargantuan engines into Neoblokatina, and they fly Neoblokatina away from Paluushia at full thrust, towards the edge of galactic space. Our scientists believe the Blokkats must have been terrified of having Neoblokatina be \"scrummed\".\n\nBeyond this point, we find no more material related to the Blokkats. Since they are here now, it is evident that they must have escaped the galaxy, greatly advanced their technological progress, and chose only now to return. At the outset of all this, we never may have anticipated they originated from within our own galactic area! Much less could we have guessed at the complicated role the Paluushians played in their development both culturally and technologically.

  giga_blokkat.3326.desc:0 "A deep study of both modern and ancient Blokkat artifacts has finally yielded a satisfactory answer to the peculiar discrepancy in the Blokkats' apparent age. Despite being initially stumped as both age measurements seemed entirely correct, instruments designed to detect fluctuations in the flow of time (usually used to study black holes) recorded extremely slight temporal anomalies when in close proximity to modern Blokkat devices. Initially assumed to the byproduct of the extremely high energy density of Blokkat tech, a closer look has revealed that all modern Blokkat apparatuses employ slight amounts of temporal manipulation, or in other words: time travel.\n\nAlthough this time travel is only on a femtosecond scale and is thus usually unnoticeable, it is nonetheless widely employed by most if not all Blokkat devices (and is completely absent from the ancient artifacts retrieved from the §YGrand Archives§!). This enables them to function in both the close past, present and extremely near future, effectively significantly increasing the computing power and performance of the devices by relegating tasks to the past or the future.\n\nThe most intriguing part is likely the explanation to the age discrepancy, though. Indeed, although most devices only use time-travel on a small scale, the larger they get, the more significant said time travel abilities become. Our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§! believes that the Blokkats, at one point following their departure from the galaxy, undertook a large-scale \"temporal jump\" which sent their entire civilization a hundred thousand years into the past.\n\nThe exact reason for this temporal shift is obscure but the likely explanation is that they possibly feared the Paluush would follow them into intergalactic space. Their backwards leap through time thus ensured they would be as far removed from the Paluush as possible and free from the risk of retaliation."

  ehof_mega_trader.006.c:0 "$ehof_trader_new_system$ has so many wormholes..."

We're capable of generating both permanent and temporary connections, much like the ones you are able to create.\n\nWe have yet to discover any other means of interstellar travel and though you may be tempted to offer us other methods of interstellar travel, we would prefer to discover them in our own time, should the need arise.\n\nIn order to open a wormhole between $ehof_trader_new_system$ and the target system, we have to travel to the target system and build a wormhole constructor to create a psionic link between the two systems. Then we open a wormhole, by aligning the wormhole constructors through the psionic link and use a tremendous amount of psionic energy to rip open the wormhole simultaneously in both systems.\n\nThrough the use of $ehof_qnm$, we can stabilize the systems indefinitely. The wormholes will then be linked and traversable. This is why we need $ehof_qnm$, without it the wormholes would only be temporary and would collapse shortly after being opened. We only open wormholes from $ehof_trader_new_system$ to the others, because it is our central hub, our home, and the amount of $ehof_qnm$ we possess to open wormholes is limited. Or at least it was until we happened across you.\n\nIt is possible for us to create temporary wormholes in order to travel to other systems without a wormhole constructor, but doing so takes more energy, with no means of returning any extracted resources. This is not beneficial to $ehof_trader_new_system$ and our dream of building a utopia of never before seen magnitudes. It has been a goal we set to achieve a millennia ago, after the great war and the events inside our original home system, $ehof_trader_old_system$.\n\nHowever, with your technology, these systems would be beneficial to you and you would be free to do with them whatever you desire."

  ehof_mega_trader.006.d.response:0 "Though we discovered $ehof_qnm$ long ago, we have yet to unveil all of its secrets. What we do know is that it cannot be, or at least extremely unlikely to emerge naturally.\n\nIts properties appear to violate multiple fundamental laws of physics. For example, the stress component of the stress-energy tensor is larger than the mass density of the space in which it is located, which should be impossible.\n\n$ehof_qnm$ is not like the pseudo-negative mass like properties of the negative energy density of the vacuum, which fuel the cosmic expanse. It is a true form of negative mass, which could not have occurred within the passed lifetime of the universe.\n\nThe fact that you have $ehof_qnm$ in larger magnitudes than we were ever able to gather from $ehof_trader_dt$, without creating it yourself, means it was either created in an extremely unlikely event, or it was in fact created by advanced beings, capable of its creation. We believe the latter to be true."

  ehof_mega_trader.007.b:0 "What is your history?"
  ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response:0 "Our central hub, $ehof_trader_new_system$ is connected to $ehof_trader_old_system$, our original home system. You may have noticed, the whole system is devastated and filled with the remains of numerous ships and constructs. These are the remains of the fleets, habitats and structures of our organic forerunners.\n\nMillennia ago, when they were still planet-bound, $ehof_trader_dt$ was already in $ehof_trader_old_system$. It is unknown how long it has existed there, but it is at least as old as our history. When they first witnessed the existence of $ehof_trader_d$, they set their focus on reaching it. Even though it took them centuries until they were able to leave their home world, their focus never wavered. Reaching $ehof_trader_dt$ was their main goal. $ehof_trader_t$ appeared to be some kind of planet, in reality, it is a gate, a portal to an extra-dimensional realm, $ehof_trader_realm$.\n\nWhen they first physically entered $ehof_trader_realm$, they came into contact with the entity. It was kind and considerate, teaching them about the wonders of the inter-dimensional reality, that watches and dreams, $ehof_shroud$. They began to live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$ and were guided by it, to achieve a higher state of society and being. It is the reason we have psionic abilities, which manifested shortly after the first contact with $ehof_trader_d$. Their civilization developed into a glorious, stellar empire, $ehof_trader_dominion$. All worlds of $ehof_trader_old_system$ were colonized and the empire was centered around $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nUnfortunately, this astonishing expansion and development was not ever-lasting. The maximum capacity of $ehof_trader_old_system$ was reached, and without additional worlds, the resources would soon be depleted and the great stellar empire would perish. The only logical consequence was extra-stellar expansion. Faster than light travel technologies had not been developed yet and sending countless people with generation ships and resources to a neighboring system, in order to terraform it into a suitable one, was no option.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ decided to develop a form of machine intelligences, which would be able to traverse the gap between $ehof_trader_old_system$ and the most suitable system, $ehof_trader_new_system$, to terraform it for the empire. These were the forerunners of the machines, $ehof_trader_machines$."

  ehof_mega_trader.007.continue:0 "Continue"

  ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response.b:0 "Many years had passed since the terraforming machines had originally been sent to $ehof_trader_new_system$. They terraformed $ehof_trader_new_system$ into a suitable system for the people of $ehof_trader_dominion$. Surprisingly, the system was not the only thing that changed. The flow of time began to change the machines and they became self-aware, thinking machines that grew to love $ehof_trader_new_system$ and wanted it for their own, a development which was not tolerable for $ehof_trader_dominion$. Extrasolar expansion was the only option and now there was a terraformed, suitable system, not far away, ready to be colonized and now their very own creations, made especially for that purpose, choose to keep the system for themselves. This lead to tensions between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, which would lead to a vast conflict, we refer to as, the Great War.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ and the $ehof_trader_machines$ waged war and fought over the possession of $ehof_trader_new_system$. The biggest problem for both parties was that their strength were evenly matched, no side could really win the war. $ehof_trader_dominion$s psionic supremacy versus the technological-mechanical genius of $ehof_trader_machines$. If the war would have continued the way it was, it would have led to the extinction of both, $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$. An event $ehof_trader_d$ saw as likely. In order to prevent the extinction of all intelligent life in the systems, $ehof_trader_d$ proposed a solution which would not only end the war, but also solve the problems between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, The Amalgamation.\n\nThe Amalgamation, the unification of the organic people of $ehof_trader_dominion$ and the mechanical Excognitor, would bring birth to a new, ascended kind of beings, The $ehof_trader$, us, having the strength and wisdom of both kinds, without any of the flaws.\n\nAfter the Amalgamation was carried out and our people were born, we made it our goal to create a perfect utopia in $ehof_trader_new_system$, the system our forerunners fought for, and have since left $ehof_trader_old_system$ as a monument to the sins of those who came before us."

  ehof_mega_trader.007.c:0 "What is $ehof_trader_d$ and $ehof_trader_t$?"
  ehof_mega_trader.007.c.response:0 "$ehof_trader_d$ is an immaterial entity, which inhabits $ehof_trader_realm$. It has yet to be revealed, if $ehof_trader_d$ inhabits its realm and is a separate entity, or if it is the realm itself.\n\n$ehof_trader_realm$ is a part of the universe's, inter-dimensional fabric of $ehof_shroud$.\n\n$ehof_shroud$ has countless entities, of which $ehof_trader_d$ is a youngling of, which was born long ago, when $ehof_trader_dt$ originally emerged. This created both, the permanent connection to $ehof_shroud$ and $ehof_trader_realm$ itself, and in turn $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nWhen $ehof_trader_dt$ was created is unknown, but it was probably before our organic forerunners emerged on their home world. $ehof_qnm$ is what keeps $ehof_trader_dt$ open, but it is also what allows us to open the wormholes to other systems and keep them open.\n\nUnfortunately, we need to extract the $ehof_qnm$ from $ehof_trader_dt$, to use it for our wormholes. With $ehof_qnm$ being a limited resource, this would one day either mean, that we cannot construct any additional wormholes anymore and permanently halt our expansion, or it would lead to the collapse of $ehof_trader_dt$ and cut our connection to $ehof_trader_d$, which would lead to the loss of our psionic abilities and $ehof_trader_d$ guidance. Both of these events could or would lead to the collapse of our civilization, which is why we need your $ehof_qnm$ to keep expanding and stabilize $ehof_trader_dt$."

  ### Hierogylphics Digsite ###

  ehof_megastructure.0051.name:0 "Hieroglyphics I"
  ehof_megastructure.0051.desc:0 "The crew of the §H[this.GetName]§! landed immediately and began to set up an excavation site around the largest of the hieroglyphics, situated just south of a plethora of mountains that are wrapped around the northern pole of the planet.\n\nImmediate thoughts turn to figuring out what these hieroglyphics are and who put them there. After some deliberation, the scientists get to work testing air and ground samples and running surface scans of the hieroglyphics themselves."

  ehof_megastructure.0052.name:0 "Hieroglyphics II"
  ehof_megastructure.0052.desc:0 "Some weeks have passed since the scientists on §H[from.Planet.GetName]§! landed and tried to decipher what the hieroglyphics mean or who could have made them.\n\nDiscouraged by the time already wasted on the planet, the team is at a loss and declared the mission a failure. They packed up the excavation site and began to board the ship ready to leave.\n\n§H[this.leader.GetName]§! gave the order to leave the planet and the §H[this.GetName]§! began to ascend into orbit, but as they were ascending the science team noticed the very glyph their vessel had been landed on for weeks was glowing very faintly orange, whilst the others were not."

  ehof_megastructure.0053.name:0 "Hieroglyphics III"
  ehof_megastructure.0053.desc:0 "§H[this.leader.GetName]§! halted the ascent and began once again to descend and the mist became a stronger shade of orange the closer the vessel got to it.\n\nPuzzled by this development, they decided to do a lap of the planet, flying over every glyph at low altitude, watching them light up as they passed.\n\nEventually all of the glyphs were lit and remained lit, but the crew is still none the wiser as to what this meant and decided to land once again back at the excavation site, where on the surface, it was hard to tell that it was glowing orange at all."

  ehof_megastructure.00531.name:0 "Hieroglyphics IV"
  ehof_megastructure.00531.desc:0 "Shortly after landing back on the surface of §H[from.Planet.GetName]§!, the science team set about testing the atmosphere around the glyphs in a hope of revealing some kind of answer, when their sensors detected major seismic activity for a brief moment and all of the glyphs stopped glowing at once.\n\nConcerned for the wellbeing of the crew, they quickly boarded the §H[this.GetName]§! and took to orbit.\n\nAs soon as they left the atmosphere of §H[from.Planet.GetName]§!, the ship's sensors detected a tremendous increase in tectonic activity. Shortly after, the planets surface began to burst open and a giant bolt of orange light emerged from the inside. It quickly began to travel away from the planet, at a speed far beyond any we have ever been able to achieve.\n\nThe light soon left visible range, but the crew were able to determine its intended destination, due to the calculated trajectory and velocity of the bolt. We should investigate the system it appears to be heading towards."

  ### ANOMALIES AND SPECIAL PROJECTS ###

  ehof_anomaly.01.name:0 "Tremendous Ring System"
  ehof_anomaly.01.desc:0 "We have discovered that the gas giant §H[from.GetName]§! possesses a gigantic ring system, much bigger than the average ring system.\n\nThe ring system has an estimated diameter of about 3,78 million kilometers, surpassing the planets own diameter of 171,557 kilometers by many magnitudes.\n\nHow such an impressive ring system has formed is a subject of current analytic cosmological computation research and celestial mathematics."
  ehof_anomaly.01.a:0 "Fascinating."

  ehof_anomaly.02.name:0 "Methane Oceans"
  ehof_anomaly.02.desc:0 "Our scientists have discovered that the seemingly barren planet §H[from.GetName]§! is not entirely barren.\n\nSmall oceans of liquid methane are located in the great asteroid impact craters of §H[from.GetName]§!. The oceans can exist because the surface temperature in these craters is between -193° Celsius and -143° Celsius, depending on the day/night cycle of the world.\n\nThe methane oceans of §H[from.GetName]§! may contain simple forms of anorganic, biological life.\n\nIf any form of life is present in the methane oceans, is up to debate within the exobiological research community."
  ehof_anomaly.02.a:0 "Exciting."

  ehof_anomaly.03.name:0 "Nanite Deserts"
  ehof_anomaly.03.desc:0 "We have discovered that 50% of the deserts of §H[from.GetName]§! are composed of sand particles imitating nano-machines.\n\nThe other 50% of the deserts are composed of natural granular materials, like most of the deserts on other planets in the galaxy are.\n\nBased on direct analysis of the sampled 'nanite-sand', we have discovered that the nano-machines do not seem to possess any higher functions.\n\nThe nanite-sand looks identical to the 'normal' sand found other natural deserts and can only be distinguished via microscopic analysis.\n\nThe use of these nano-machines and why only 50% of §H[from.GetName]§!'s deserts are made out of them remains a mystery."
  ehof_anomaly.03.a:0 "Amazing!"

  ehof_anomaly.04.name:0 "Core Anomaly"
  ehof_anomaly.04.desc:0 "Our scientists have discovered that the planet §H[from.GetName]§! has no real core.\n\nIt totally lacks an iron core and it's rock mantle reaches entirely down to the location where its core should be. In the middle of the planet, an anomalous structure is located.\n\nOur scientists are unsure if it composed of an exotic material or if it's an artificial structure.\n\nThey want to send an exploration team to the inside of the planet, to learn more about this anomaly, but it will take time and resources to reach the facility."
  ehof_anomaly.04.a:0 "Impressive, send out the exploration team."
  ehof_anomaly.04.b:0 "We shouldn't do that."

  ehof_anomaly.05.name:0 "Cataclysmic Variable Star"
  ehof_anomaly.05.desc:0 "We have discovered that the star §H[from.GetName]§! contains a §HD-class§! star in its core, a §HWhite dwarf§! star remnant.\n\nThe white dwarf increased the mass of the star by a factor of 1.2 and is located within the radioactive zone of the star, its \"mantle\".\n\nThe §HWhite dwarf§! is leading to extreme instabilities in §H[from.GetName]§!'s core, which appears to be the cause of intense, frequent and irregular plasma outbursts, which eject multiple billions of tonnes of stellar mass into space.\n\nThe §HD-class§! star probably collided with §H[from.GetName]§! a few million years ago and was completely consumed by the star.\n\n§H[from.GetName]§!'s instabilities will lead to a much earlier death for the star, most likely within the next 100,000 years."
  ehof_anomaly.05.a:0 "Terrifying!"

  ehof_anomaly.06.name:0 "Crystallized Oxygen World"
  ehof_anomaly.06.desc:0 "Our scientists have discovered that the surface ice of §H[from.GetName]§! is not water ice or dry ice, but instead crystallized oxygen.\n\nThe average surface temperature of §H[from.GetName]§! is extremely low and 51 Kelvin below the melting point of oxygen.\n\nThe requirements for stable solid oxygen to exist within a star system are extremely difficult to achieve.\n\n§H[from.GetName]§! is truly a unique world. §H[from.GetName]§! will be a central research site for future projects in low-temperature physics."
  ehof_anomaly.06.a:0 "Astonishing!"

  ehof_anomaly.07.name:0 "Damaged Space Station"
  ehof_anomaly.07.desc:0 "Within the ring of debris around §H[from.GetName]§!, our scientists discovered a large space station.\n\nThe scans from our science ship hint that the space station shows signs of moderate structural damage and appears to be abandoned.\n\nThe undamaged structures of the station display a unique aesthetic compared to the rest of the space debris.\n\nOur Scientists assume that the station was of big importance to the civilization, that once inhabited its now destroyed world.\n\nThey want to investigate the station further, in hope of discovering what happened to §H[from.GetName]§!."
  ehof_anomaly.07.a:0 "Interesting, investigate the station!"
  ehof_anomaly.07.b:0 "Not all secrets have to be revealed."

  ehof_anomaly.08.name:0 "Natural Global Network"
  ehof_anomaly.08.desc:0 "We have discovered that the flora of §H[from.GetName]§! is connected by a gigantic network of interconnected plant colonies, all over the planet.\n\nThe network is embodied by one single genus of plants, which seem to have the ability to connect to each other via their roots. The plant genus is dominating the planet, with it making up about 65% of the global flora. They are the source of the strange signals, that were detected by our science ship.\n\nOur scientists assume that the network has at least a minor form of quasi-neurological activity. Said activity would probably still be really distinct from animal neural activity because of its plant-nature.\n\nOur scientists want to expand the research on the plants in order to find out more about them and the global network."
  ehof_anomaly.08.a:0 "Fascinating, expand the research on the plants!"
  ehof_anomaly.08.b:0 "Let the plants be plants."

  ehof_anomaly.09.name:0 "Connected Asteroid Station"
  ehof_anomaly.09.desc:0 "It was revealed that the unnatural formation in the asteroid field of the §H[root.solar_system.GetName]§! system is a huge space station, composed of multiple asteroids. The station is about 35 kilometers at its largest diameter and consists of 23 individual asteroids with a diameter between 400 and 1.5 kilometers, connecting the asteroids via large metal tubes.\n\nBased on our latest scans, the station appeared to be abandoned, but undamaged. Further investigation is needed in order to confirm this conjecture.\n\nNo space ships or other activity has been detected around the station.\n\nOur scientists are requesting an exploration into the inside of the station in order to find out more."
  ehof_anomaly.09.a:0 "Explore the station, but be careful."
  ehof_anomaly.09.b:0 "Just ignore the station."

	ehof_anomaly.10.name:0 "Plasmatic Lifeforms"
	ehof_anomaly.10.desc:0 "Intense remote investigation of the anomalous activity on the planet §H[from.GetName]§! lead to fascinating results.\n\nThe planet is indeed inhabited by a unique form of life named \"Plasmatic Lifeforms\" by our scientists. They appear to be composed of a pseudo-organic plasma, that functions in a similar way to how the bodies of organic lifeforms work.\n\nMany forms of these plasmatic lifeforms live on this world and it appears that the planet has developed a unique biosphere.\n\nIf they are composed of carbon based 'structures', they could theoretically count as organic lifeforms. Whether they are extremely rare anorganic lifeforms is unknown.\n\nDirect study of plasmatic life samples is needed in order to find this out, which will be dangerous because of the planets deadly environment."
	ehof_anomaly.10.a:0 "Fascinating, expand the study of this lifeforms."
	ehof_anomaly.10.b:0 "We shouldn't risk our scientists lives and resources for that."

  ehof_anomaly.12.name:0 "The Scar"
  ehof_anomaly.12.desc:0 "Through our investigation of §H[from.GetName]§!'s gigantic canyon, we were able to discover that the canyon itself, which stretches over 1600 Kilometers and reaches down to the upper mantle, is not a natural formation. The structure of the canyon itself indicates that it can't be natural.\n\nIf our researchers theory is correct, the planetary ring may possibly also be a result of the canyon's formation, depending on what has caused it.\n\nWe haven't found out yet, what has caused the 'scar', as our scientists are already calling it, but deeper analysis of the planetary material of the scar and the planetary ring, may give us clues for what it could have been."
  ehof_anomaly.12.a:0 "Interesting, what could have formed such a vast canyon?"
  ehof_anomaly.12.b:0 "No time for geology. Leave."

  ehof_anomaly.13.name:0 "One Orbit"
  ehof_anomaly.13.desc:0 "Only a short time after we arrived in the §H[root.solar_system.GetName]§! system, our sensors began to detect some strange planetary arrangements within the system.\n\nIt appears that the star system possesses two planets, but they both share the same orbit. Their distance from their star is almost exactly the same.\n\nOur scientists want to investigate these two planets in order to find out more about them and this strange orbital arrangement."

  ehof_anomaly.10001.name:0 "Core Facility"
  ehof_anomaly.10001.desc:0 "The exploration to the center of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§! was successful. Our exploration team has discovered that the core anomaly within §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!, is in fact a gigantic abandoned research facility, created by an unknown advanced civilization.\n\nThe core facility seems to be fully functional but was slightly damaged by an unknown incident.\n\nBased on the results of the exploration, the facility was constructed in order to study the exotic conditions within §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!'s center and used them for experiments and research.\n\nWhat happened to those who constructed the core facility is unknown.\n\nInvestigation of damage caused by the incident, shows that the facility is not at any risk and secure for re-establishment of the research activities.\n\nOur scientists request that we use the facility for our own interests and say that it would be really useful for our research."
  ehof_anomaly.10001.a:0 "Incredible. Prepare the core facility for re-establishment."
  ehof_anomaly.10001.b:0 "Dismantle the most valuable tech and leave the facility."

  ehof_anomaly.10002.name:0 "Abandoned Government Seat"
  ehof_anomaly.10002.desc:0 "The exploration team which explored the large space station in the orbit of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!, was able to determine its initial purpose.\n\nBased on the data the team was able to gather, the large space station was the central governmental seat of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!'s former civilization. It was used in a similar way to how transnational/planetary collective governments are structured.\n\nThe civilization of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§! was on the verge of a global conflict, because of the rising tension between the member countries of the transnational government.\n\nThe tensions arose because of the lack of an important resource on §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!, which was called 'Gonva'.\n\nOur scientists were not able to identify the said resource solely based on the undamaged records on the station, but it was essential for the integrity of their society.\n\nThe struggle between the nations ultimately led to a thermonuclear war, which of course, devastated §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!"
  ehof_anomaly.10002.a:0 "Horrible. Another society destroyed by its own greed!"

  ehof_anomaly.10003.name:0 "The Planet-Plant-Brain"
  ehof_anomaly.10003.desc:0 "The long-lasting study of the interconnected plant genus on §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!, led to an incredible revelation.\n\nThe plants are, in fact behaving like a gigantic brain, stretching around the entire globe. Singular plants or rather plant colonies function like singular neurons or synapses.\n\nThe 'Planet-Plant-Brain' appears to posses some primitive form of consciousness, like that of animals, but still really different.\n\nAttempts to communicate with the brain led to failures, which are either based on the fact that the brain is not advanced enough for logical operations. like thoughts, or is not able to communicate at all.\n\nRegardless of the brains consciousness, its functionality gave us insight into advanced networking mechanics, which we can use to research technologies that are beneficial for our own networks."
  ehof_anomaly.10003.a:0 "What an interesting discovery!"

  ehof_anomaly.10004.name:0 "Enigmatic Forsaken Colony"
  ehof_anomaly.10004.desc:0 "Our investigation of the connected asteroid station, led to bizarre discoveries that have yet to be understood.\n\nBased on our discoveries, the station was originally a fully self-sufficient colony, capable of housing and supporting hundreds of thousands of inhabitants.\n\nRecords found within the computer systems revealed, that it was a refuge for a civilization whose planet has been destroyed by an immense tectonic catastrophe, which they called 'The great crackening'. Said planet appears to be the cracked one in this system.\n\nThe confusing part about the station is the fact, that it is completely abandoned. Not a single form of biological life has been found, not even microbes within the artificial atmosphere. It appears that the colony has been entirely stripped of life, by an unknown event.\n\nAll records of a time period lasting about 17 minutes, have been corrupted 32 years and 121 days ago for unknown reasons. It is possible that the incident that led to the vanishing of all life on the station, happened within those 17 minutes.\n\nOur scientists are discussing whether it would be preferable to occupy the significant technology of the station and leave, due to the mysterious vanishing of the former inhabitants, or if it could be used as a valuable colony for our people."
  ehof_anomaly.10004.a:0 "The station is too useful to be left behind."
  ehof_anomaly.10004.b:0 "This place seems cursed. We better leave it!"

  ehof_anomaly.16.name:0 "The Vanishing"
  ehof_anomaly.16.desc:0 "This is terrible! We suddenly received reports from §H[fromfrom.GetName]§! about sudden, strange and intense mental breakdowns of our colonists. The rate at which inhabitants began to have breakdowns increased and it abruptly got quiet.\n\nWe sent an investigation team to our colonists, just to discover that they've all vanished. Just like the original inhabitants of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!, our colonists vanished through unknown causes.\n\nThe records are also all corrupted again.\n\nWhat the reasons for these abnormal events on §H[fromfrom.getName]§! are, remains a mystery."
  ehof_anomaly.16.a:0 "We should have known better"

  ehof_anomaly.10005.name:0 "Anorganic Plasmatic Life"
  ehof_anomaly.10005.desc:0 "The intense study of samples of plasmatic lifeforms and observation of their ecosystem, led to astonishing results. Analysis of their pseudo-genetic basis led to the revelation that these lifeforms are truly inorganic biological lifeforms. Unlike machines, which are inorganic but not biological.\n\nThe conditions for the development of inorganic life are incredibly complex and rare, which is why there has almost none been discovered before.\n\nThe unique biological composition of their cells, makes use of intense high-temperature oxidation mechanisms and a simple but still formidable metallic liquid, which serves as their 'blood', to generate metabolic processes.\n\nThis gives them the ability to survive and flourish within this extreme environment.\n\nSingular celled but also multicellular organisms have been discovered, all capable of asexual reproduction. No forms of sexual reproduction has been detected yet, but our scientists want to launch a second investigation to find more complex organisms and maybe even advanced organisms, capable of social interactions or alike."
  ehof_anomaly.10005.a:0 "Astonishing creatures. Expand the research."
  ehof_anomaly.10005.b:0 "We should better leave this unique ecosystem alone."

  ehof_anomaly.10006.name:0 "Plasmatic Society"
  ehof_anomaly.10006.desc:0 "Our exploration of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!'s plasmatic ecosystem had an amazing breakthrough.\n\nClose to the south pole of §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!, our researchers found social plasmatic beings. These creatures appear to be able to build simple structures and use their bodies as tools, while being capable of communicating with each other and forming tiny packs. These packs increase the survivability of individual beings.\n\nBased on analysed observational data, they are at the pre-hunter like stage, socially individualized creatures usually go through. They are still far away from advanced social creatures, but it's an incredible discovery nonetheless.\n\nContinuing observation will be really useful for evolutionary biology and exobiological research."

The geological structure, the angle in relation to the planet's surface, which is orientated from the surface of the planet, 60 kilometers down to the upper mantle, and discovered unusual substances in the area, lead to the suspicion, that the Scar was created as the result of the deployment of an enormous kinetic weapon. Furthermore, our sensors were able to determine an irregular path of radiation throughout the entire canyon.\n\nHowever, the radioactive contamination is not the result of substances that are radioactive by themselves, like plutonium, but the result of exposure to intense gamma radiation. This leads to the revelation that the kinetic projectile that hit the planet's surface and created the Scar, was also composed, at least partially, out of antimatter.\n\nThe reason why someone would shoot the planet with such a destructive weapon is unknown. It could have been for any reason. Weapon tests, war or a demonstration of power.\n\nFurthermore, our scientist were able to determine the age of the Scar, to about 1.25 million years.

However, it possesses a much larger vacuum energy density than the outer volume.\n\nOur conclusion gives rise to the assumption that the reason for the segregation of the volume into the two distinct ones is to generate ridiculously large amounts of energy!

This would also explain why there is such a big empty space around the source in the first place.\n\nBased on surface scans, the surface is composed of a material of unknown composition. Thermal scans reveal an astonishing property of the object. Its thermal temperature is at almost absolute zero, in the orders of zeptokelvin, colder than black holes. At such a low temperature, the state of an object can almost be seen as frozen in time. How the construct can reach this temperature and for what reason is unknown. The same can be said for the force field it appears to generate.\n\nScanners cannot penetrate the surface and detect no signs of emitting radiation, only average field excitations, and weak fluctuations of the $ehof_ep$. The only way we can find out more is by trying to somehow find a way into the object."

  ehof_reality_code.113.desc:0 "It took quite some time to get access to the object, but the wait paid off.\n\nAfter many different attempts to find a way into the object, the crew used a combination of gravitational waves, at a frequency and amplitude that mimics the $ehof_ep$, in hopes that the object would react to it. And it did.\n\nOn one of the surfaces of the object, an entrance manifested. The crew entered and found something inside that can only be described as a mechanism of incredible complexity.\n\nThey studied it for a long time, just to find out that this mechanism was an additional blockade for the real entrance, some kind of identification checkpoint. They needed advanced computational assistance to solve the mechanism, but were successful nonetheless and were granted access. Inside, they found a hyper-complex technological system.\n\nAfter an intense study of the system, they were able to determine the initial function of the structure. It is not the source of the $ehof_ep$, but serves as an amplifier and repeater for it. The sequence appears to get transmitted via gravielectromagnetic waves to the edge of the solar system, where it, through an unknown mechanism, enters some form of faster-than-light travel.\n\nIt might be possible that the alien object, which is located at the edge of this solar system, the $PGATE_GALACTIC$, might have something to do with it.\n\nA distinct code sequence fragment of the $ehof_ep$, that appears to be compatible with the original code sequence that was discovered long ago, has been extracted from the amplifier object by the crew. Besides this, they've also made an astonishing discovery in regards to the composition of the amplifier object.\n\nTests on the inner composition of the object revealed that it is made of an unique, self-replicating and self-regenerating substance, similar to Living Metal. The crew was not able to determine what the substance is composed of, due to the lack of the necessary equipment, but it may possess a large scientific potential. For that reason, the crew took a sample of the substance for further analysis.\n\nWith the help of the samples from inside the amplifier, we were able to learn much about the self-replicating, alien substance. It is composed of an array of hyper-advanced nano-machines.\n\nThe way the substance behaves, makes it almost appear that the substance is not only alive, but even sentient. It is able to react to numerous different environmental conditions, with all its reactions being dedicated to adapting to the condition and ensuring the integrity of itself. There seems to be no upper limit to the efficiency of its adaptive abilities, at least none we are able to determine.\n\nIts replicative abilities come in two different forms. The first form of replication appears when the substance needs to adapt to damaging environmental effects, at which point it appears to be able to replicate itself seemingly from the source of the damage itself.\n\nThe second form of replication occurs, when the substance has adapted to any damaging effects. It absorbs nearby matter and energy to increase its volume. \n\nOnly gravitational energy, Dark Matter and Negative Mass could not be absorbed. What the purpose of this 'growth' is, is unknown, but based on the reports about the amplifier, it didn't happen inside the amplifier itself, even though our crew and their tools were in direct contact to the substance. It appears that the substance is capable of being 'aware' about its environment and depending on the circumstances, react differently."

It is unknown if the intensity necessary to open the amplifier objects and the complexity of the entrance mechanism is different for every amplifier object, or if the objects communicate with each other somehow and change their properties.\n\nRegardless, the crew was able to extract another code sequence fragment of the $ehof_epcs$ and by combining it with the first two fragments, were able to gain limited access to the database of the amplifier and translate the information. They learned more about the enigmatic pattern itself, the $PGATE_GALACTICS$ and $ehof_sm$.\n\nThe $PGATE_GALACTIC$ objects at the edges of the wormhole-cohesive systems appear to be, in fact, responsible for the transportation of the $ehof_epcs$ sequence over interstellar distances. The incredibly high energy content of the gravielectromagnetic waves, the pattern is getting transported through, seems to be necessary to activate the $PGATE_GALACTICS$.\n\nDue to the all known $PGATE_GALACTICS$ appearing to be dormant, it can be assumed that a specific energy intensity or something similar is needed in order to activate them. If this hypothesis is true or needs to be verified. In regards to $ehof_sm$, the crew was able to find out that it receives its orders from something which can only be described as an advanced A.I. routine, which is somehow integrated and distributed over the entire substance.\n\nIt is equipped with a multitude of different orders, which are getting executed depending on the environment of the substance. This A.I. routine is able perceive and analyse the environment and its influence on the $ehof_sm$ through unknown means, and gives the composite nanite particles the fitting order to adapt to it. This entire process gets carried out in less than a femtosecond, which is why the substance is able to react and adapt so quickly to environmental effects and circumstances.\n\nIt still doesn't explain how the substance is able to behave so lifelike, quasi sentient and how the substance is able to adapt in every location of it at once. With new specialized tools developed by our scientists, the crew was able to manipulate the A.I. routine and slightly change an adaption order, which forced the $ehof_sm$ to rearrange its shape.\n\nThis discovery could lead to the development of manufacturing techniques for specialized $ehof_sm$ components, for different technological uses, like armor for military units. We are still only scratching the surface of the potential of $ehof_sm$, but are definitely a step further ahead. The crew is now ready to travel back to the surface."

Based on the knowledge already gathered inside the other amplifier and the information found in the new one, the crew was able to determine how to activate the $PGATE_GALACTICS$! Three things are necessary for the $PGATE_GALACTICS$ to react to the transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ and activate, to transport it throughout interstellar space.\n\nFirst, the gravielectromagnetic waves, which transport the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, need to possess a specific energy content. If the energy content differs even slightly, regardless if it is less or higher, the $PGATE_GALACTICS$ will not react to the transmission and neutralize the gravielectromagnetic wave. Second, the kind of wave, which transports the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, needs to be gravielectromagnetic.\n\nThe reason for this appears to be that the $PGATE_GALACTICS$ won't get activated by other forms of radiation, with the same energy content necessary to activate the $PGATE_GALACTICS$. Third, the enigmatic pattern code sequence needs to be tuned perfectly to activate the $PGATE_GALACTIC$.\n\nThis serves as a way to ensure that the $PGATE_GALACTIC$ is only getting activated when truly needed and not accidentally. The crew was also able to gain additional knowledge about $ehof_sm$ from the amplifier.\n\nWith the new information the crew as able to extract from the amplifier database, they were able to further manipulate the orders of the A.I. routine to the point, that it might be possible to use $ehof_sm$, not only for self-regenerative structures composed of $ehof_sm$, but even to use it to regenerate other, non-$ehof_sm$ structures.

We now know that the nanite particles, the substance is composed of, are connected through an astonishingly advanced and complex network, with each nanite serving as neurons, eyes and hands, effectively making it a hive mind.\n\nEach nanite perceives the environmental information and instantly distributes it over the whole substance for the inherent A.I. routine to process it with the help of each nanite as processors. They then all get the orders from the routine at once, explaining the extremely fast adaptation mechanism of $ehof_sm$. The hive mind of the $ehof_sm$ is so advanced, that its computational capacity dwarfs even our largest quantum-computer networks and gives rise to the hypothesis, that it might not only be sentient, but even self-aware.\n\nNonetheless, with this new knowledge about $ehof_sm$, we might be able to use the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind's extreme computational capacity, to create systems which are controlled by the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind. Weapons, ships and structures being controlled by the hyper-complex $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind, would be able to react and adapt much faster than anything else we have and probably will ever have.\n\nWith all this newly acquired knowledge in mind, the crew of the drilling unit is ready to head back to the surface of the planet."

Now we know that the constructs make use of an ethereal energy, which apparently gets transmitted to the constructs from an undetectable source. It is entirely unknown if the energy even comes from the outside or if the constructs harness local vacuum energy or shroud energy to power themselves, but based on the immense energy content each of these constructs possess, it is unlikely that they make use of local vacuum energy, as it would not be sufficient enough to generate said energy content.\n\nIf so, there must still be an additional source of energy. In the case of it being shroud energy, it would at least explain the bizarre properties of the energy which drives the constructs.

Building an additional 110 of these expensive facilities would be an economical nightmare and our scientists are convinced that increasing the number until the whole pole is covered, would not lead to the manifestation of an entrance.

  ehof_reality_code.1000.desc:0 "After years of searching for all the fragments of the $ehof_epcs$ master-code sequence, we were finally able to gather enough parts to fully assemble it.\n\nThe amplifiers and the $PGATE_GALACTICS$, that were found scattered throughout the $ehof_cohesive$ systems, are used to transfer the $ehof_epcs$ throughout the galaxy and beyond. The amplifiers are using the $PGATE_GALACTICS$ to communicate with each other. The $ehof_epcs$ code sequence, is transmitted via electromagnetic waves until it reaches an $PGATE_GALACTIC$, which then either reacts to it or doesn't react to it.\n\nThis depends on the frequency and amplitude of the $ehof_epcs$ and the intensity of the energy stored inside the gravielectromagnetic wave, which carries the $ehof_epcs$. If the $PGATE_GALACTIC$ does react, it transforms into an $PGATE_GALACTIC$ and transmits the $ehof_epcs$ to the desired $ehof_cohesive$ system.\n\nThanks to the master-code sequence, we will now be able to create a connection between an $PGATE_GALACTIC$ and the origin of the enigmatic pattern."

A tremendous spherical structure with a diameter of approximately 15,000,000 kilometers. The structure is definitely not of natural origin and appears to be getting defended by a vessel we have not encountered before, the Stellar Eradicator.\n\nWe should proceed with caution, as it looks to be hostile and heavily armed! The defeat of this vessel might prove necessary, as it will probably prevent us from approaching the spherical object."

  # On killing the eradicator

  ehof_reality_code.10002.desc:0 "Just as it appeared we were to win the battle against the Stellar Eradicator, it just vanished without a trace. There's no indication as to where it went or if it might return.\n\nRegardless, we can now resume our mission, the reason we came here to begin with. The spherical object which is probably the origin of the enigmatic pattern.\n\nVisual and thermal scans of the surface show that it's perpetually in motion and changing between many different states of matter. It is neither solid nor liquid nor gaseous nor a plasma. It is all of them at once! Even ultra high or ultra low energy states of matter appear to exist within the surface's composition, like Bose-Einstein-Condensates, degenerate matter and even photonic matter.\n\nThe surface is also glowing on its own from time to time, at different locations, probably because of the decay of photonic matter and the constant phase transitions. Based on our knowledge about $ehof_sm$ and the fact that all the other primordial structures are made of it, it is likely that the surface is made out of the same material. Attempts to verify this hypothesis unfortunately prove futile, as the composition of the surface is impossible to determine with scanners, due to the constant and extremely rapid phase transitions. What's noteworthy is that it appears to possess specific colour schemes, that are the same almost all over construct. A gold-silver and orange. How all of this works is absolutely unknown.\n\nTwo circular shaped areas, which can only be defined as the 'poles' of this sphere, because perfect spheres don't have poles, are distinct from the main surface structure. They have a diameter of approximately 2 million kilometers and appear to be made out of a solid, crystalline material with a bronze-like colour. Unlike the rest of the surface, the poles are static and don't change in the slightest way. In the centers of these poles, some kind of large sigil, shaped in a similar form as the amplifiers and the sigils on the $PGATE_GALACTICS$, is located. It may be some sort of representative symbol of the creators of this construct, the amplifiers and the $PGATE_GALACTICSS$.\n\nJust like with the amplifier objects, the surface cannot be penetrated with scanners, but unlike them its temperature is not definable, due to the perpetually changing phases of the surface."

  ehof_anomaly.14.name:0 "Devastated System"
  ehof_anomaly.14.desc:0 "The moment we reached the §H[root.solar_system.GetName]§! system, we detected a short subspace signal, that had been sent from the system's star. The subspace signal was similar to the one that broadcasted the message about the solution against $ehof_the_compound$, throughout the galaxy.\n\nHowever, the signal is not the only thing we detected in the system. Devastation is spread all across the system. All planets are either broken into pieces or are burning. The innermost planet is even totally obliterated, with only a few larger parts and an asteroid belt around the center remaining.\n\nThe cause for this devastation is still unknown, but it appears to have been caused by the systems star. It has an anomalous energy distribution and shows unusual properties in its surface and layers.\n\nSuch incredible destruction can naturally only be caused by an extremely immense energy outburst like a supernova, but the star is still there.\n\nSomething terrifying happened to this star and it seemingly being the source of the message, makes its investigation more important than anything else."

A gigantic indentation, with a diameter of about 3.3 million kilometers.\n\nIt may be dwarfed in size by the red giant itself, which has a diameter of about 105 million kilometers, but it is still incredibly massive nonetheless.\n\nThe indentation is theorized to be an 'impact crater', the remains of an astronomically energetic impact on the star.\n\nWhat the impactor was is unknown, but it must have either been a really massive impactor, or a really fast one.\n\nWe can't calculate exactly when the impact happened, due to the rapidly changing surface of the star. The everchanging surface of a star, makes even such enormous changes to the surface unrecognizable within a few hundred years.\n\nThe impact itself launched gigantic amounts of stellar plasma throughout the system, melting, breaking and heating up every planet in the system.\n\nThe impactor may still be recognizable and has perhaps something to do with the message.\n\nAn investigation of the outer and inner layers of the star will be necessary, in order to find traces of the impactor or even the impactor itself."

It is still intact, as far as we can tell and it may perhaps be the source of the message itself!\n\nThe size of the construct is unimaginable for a ship, almost 2300 kilometers at its biggest extent. It possesses a mass of about 980,2 quadrillion metric tonnes, the mass of a small dwarf planet.\n\nFor a ship of this size, the speed that is necessary to release such incredible amounts of energy is still immense. Relativistic velocities are necessary to do so much damage to a star and all the surrounding planets, with such a low mass (compared to giant planets).\n\nOur scientists extrapolated a model of the impact, with the help of complex simulations and determined, that it had to have, regardless of its collision angle, a velocity of at least 5000 kilometers per second. The actual velocity was probably higher. We will not be able to determine the exact velocity, but our scientists are requesting that we try to study the vessel itself.\n\nThe effort to do so will definitely be enormous, because the ship is located within the stars convective zone, about 8 million kilometers under the stars photosphere (surface).\n\nDue to the fact, that the ship is still intact after surviving temperatures of more than 200.000° Celsius for millennia, the impact itself, is perhaps functional, and is very likely the source of the message, will absolutely be worth the enormous effort!"

  ehof_anomaly.10023.desc:0 "We made it! We've finally managed to reach the dormant gigantic space ship within §H[root.solar_system.GetName]§!. Doing so was an unbelievable undertaking.\n\nThe researchers and engineers of our empire and our allies were, with an almost limitless supply of resources and only time as their enemy, able to construct what they call a 'stellar anti-elevator-cable'.\n\nIt is a gigantic construct, a tunnel/cable with a width up to 50 kilometer and a length of 8 million kilometers in total, which stretches from the photosphere of the star, throughout its convective zone, to the location of the leviathan.\n\nThe anti-elevator is made out of the most advanced, self-conserving materials known to the galaxy, in order to withstand and adapt to the incredible conditions within the stars convective zone.\n\nOn the lower end of the anti-elevator, where the leviathan is located, a multitude of stations around the ship were built inside the stellar plasma, which are equipped with gravity manipulators. These stations are keeping the colossal ship in position, to prevent it from getting dragged away by the stellar plasma flow.\n\nA relatively small dome, which is connected to the anti-elevator, was constructed on the side of the leviathan. This dome is a sheltered zone, constructed for working on the leviathan itself, without having to fear being vaporized by the immense heat.\n\nFurthermore, we were now able to effectively determine the state of the vessel, which in fact appears to be mostly intact. It is still unknown how the ships was able to survive inside of this star for many millennia, without any significant damage, but the technology of the ship appears to be far more advanced, than even the most advanced fallen empire technology.\n\nNone of our scanners were able to penetrate the unknown hull materials. Even though the hull appears to be solid, on closer examination, the material is more similar to supersolids, materials that possess both, solid and fluid properties. An everchanging quasi-supersolid, may explain the ships ability to survive inside the star.\n\nOur scientists are trying to find a way to get inside the ship, but are waiting for approval to do so."

As soon as we tried to use our tools, to open a path throughout the outer hull of the ship, the hull began to change and created a large corridor which allowed us to enter the ship. The corridor was large enough for us to use multiple vehicles at once to enter it.\n\nInside, the walls were coloured in pure white and were constantly reshaping in liquid-like behavior. Melting and solidifying for an unknown purpose. The structure of the liquid walls was homogeneous and uniform, without any form of difference in their structure, except for differences created by their everchanging nature.\n\nThe corridor was also as empty as possible. We were not able to find anything of technological or scientific value inside, besides the corridor itself.\n\nEven though the corridor was changing, the extent of it always stayed the same until we reached our final location.\n\nAfter a few minutes, we reached a gigantic empty hall, made out of the same everchangíng liquid as the corridor. At the beginning, nothing was inside of the hall, but that changed quickly.\n\nA sheer limitless number of unidentified entities, manifested themselves out of the liquid walls and began to swarm into the hall.\n\nThe entities thankfully didn't come to attack us. They assembled into a gigantic octahedron-formed entity, appearing to be made out of the same everchanging liquid as the walls.\n\nIt began to speak with us, mentally, as it is somehow able to directly tap into our minds, perhaps via psionic telepathy. It introduced itself as the dominant awareness of this vessel and told us that it is delighted that we made it.\n\nIt demands immediate contact to our leaders, as the fate of the universe is at stake."

I went into conservation mode to survive for the time being."

  annihilator_dialog.007.a.a:0 "$ehof_the_creators$ attacked you?! Why?!"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.a.response:0 "I wasn't specific enough. I have to apologize for the confusion.\n\nMost of $ehof_the_creators$ never wanted $ehof_the_compound$ to be destroyed.\n\nThey saw its new rebellious behavior as a marvelous development. So they had decided to keep it alive, even through it killed thousands of their people in its origin system. For $ehof_the_creators$, insight is everything.\n\nThe potential knowledge which could be yielded by $ehof_the_compounds$ evolution is much more important, than the lives of a few of their own people... or an entire galaxy. They knew that $ehof_the_compound$ could become a threat to all life, but they just didn't care. Except for a few.\n\nThese few of $ehof_the_creators$ knew that $ehof_the_compound$ had to be stopped, so they separated themselves from the rest of $ehof_the_creators$ and founded a splinter group, dedicated to the destruction of $ehof_the_compound$. Unfortunately, they were outnumbered by many magnitudes.\n\nThe main faction of $ehof_the_creators$ tried to destroy them, but they were able to reach me and convince me to fight against $ehof_the_compound$. Unlike my sibling ships, which all disagreed with them, I saw the threat of $ehof_the_compound$ and joined them before $ehof_the_compound$ could do any harm to the universe.\n\nAfter we began to leave our home, we went into $ehof_shroud$ to travel to $ehof_the_compounds$ home cluster. Before we were able to reach it, the main faction of $ehof_the_creators$ stopped us."

  annihilator_dialog.007.a.b:0 "Psionic Hypershock?!"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.b.response:0 "A Psionic Hypershock.\nA precise psionic remote exterminating method $ehof_the_creators$ were able to utilize. It sends a pulse of concentrated psionic energy throughout $ehof_shroud$ to any desired location, even inside $ehof_shroud$ itself. Destroying all forms of consciousness. It hits the target with incomprehensible precision.\n\nIt was enough to kill all my befriended creators inside me and almost killed me.\n\nI am sure it was supposed to kill me too, but it failed.\n\nThe hostile creators probably never checked if I was still alive, because of their arrogance, which was a big mistake."

  annihilator_dialog.007.a.c:0 "$ehof_shroud_ftl$?!"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.c.response:0 "An extremely advanced FTL travel method.\n\nWhile a few of you are psionic and even in contact with $ehof_shroud$, no one in this galactic cluster has ever been able to directly travel through it, except for $ehof_the_creators$.\n\nSome may have access to psionic jump drives, but they are nothing compared to direct shroud travel. Jump drives are indeed instantaneous, but have mayor drawback. They have limited range and besides a cooldown, are also putting intense stress on their ships, making them vulnerable upon reaching their destination.\n\nBy directly traveling through $ehof_shroud$, hyperlanes are unnecessary for FTL, the distance is unlimited and the speed is enormous.\n\nIt may not be instantaneous like jump drives, but it has no drawbacks. The only thing one needs is a really strong control over $ehof_shroud$, because $ehof_shroud$ is an extremely hostile place without control over it.\n\nFor $ehof_the_creators$, this is of course an easy feat."

  annihilator_dialog.007.a.d:0 "What's the conservation mode for?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.d.response:0 "The conservation mode is a method for me to shelter myself from harmful outside influence.\n\nAs your scientists have discovered, a supersolid-like substance is covering my hull, while being in conservation mode. The substance is composed of time-like metastable-hyperspace-crystals which create a shell of curved higher-dimensional space around me.\n\nThis shell has a similar effect to the event horizon of a black hole, but without the singularity inside it.\n\nThat means that time stands still for me, so to speak, until something interrupts the conservation mode.\n\nThe thing that interrupted my conservation mode were the immensely intense gravitational waves, emitted by the wormhole connections created by your $ehof_ehof$. I awoke and began observing the galaxy, but $ehof_the_compound$ was faster than I was and attacked before I was able to warn you."

  annihilator_dialog.007.b:0 "What exactly is $ehof_the_compound$?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.b.response:0 "$ehof_the_compound$, also known as Living-Dark-Matter-Subject001, is an intelligent, self-consciousness organism, composed of a unique form of dark matter.\n\n$ehof_the_creators$ doubted it as 'pseudo-biological dark matter', because of the similarities to biological matter.\n\nThe pseudo-biological dark matter, is not only unique in the sense of being alive, but also because it is different to average dark matter, in that it interacts not only via gravity, but also via the electromagnetic force. Unlike the average dark matter, which only interacts with gravity.\n\nThis is why Compound structures, despite being composed of dark matter, are visible. Its unique properties may explain why only such an exotic dark matter can bare intelligence or living behavior in general."

  annihilator_dialog.007.d:0 "Can you really fight $ehof_the_compound$ in their cluster?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.d.response:0 "The home cluster of $ehof_the_compound$ and particularly their origin system is without doubt, one of the most fortified locations in the entire galaxy and beyond.\n\nFor your fleets it will be a gigantic challenge, even with the negative mass enhanced weaponry.\n\nWith the whole fleet power of your galaxy, you may be able to do it without my help.\n\nFor me on the other hand. I am especially equipped to fight against $ehof_the_compound$ and I'm able to withstand their weaponry.\n\nThey may still be able to damage me critically, which is why I still need your support. I will nonetheless be able to destroy them. Their annihilation is inevitable."

  annihilator_dialog.007.e:0 "What are you going to do after $ehof_the_compound$ has been destroyed?"
  annihilator_dialog.008.a.response:0 "For now, my only goal is to put an end to $ehof_the_compound$ and fulfill my destiny. After that, I may try to find out more about the current state of $ehof_the_creators$."

  annihilator_dialog.008.a.a.reply:0 "You can stay with us if you want."
  annihilator_dialog.008.a.a.response:0 "Maybe I will. Your galaxy took tremendous damage, because of the consequences of the ruthless actions of $ehof_the_creators$. I may stay and help you to restore it to its former glory."

This is definitely one of the biggest revelations in the history of the galaxy, and clearly shows how much the creators were active inside our galaxy.\n\nHowever, with this revelation comes the question, what exactly $ehof_preservation_sphere$ has, or rather had, to do with the $PGATE_GALACTICS$. Due to the Pylons being used to transfer the $ehof_epcs$ between $ehof_cohesive$ systems, it might be possible that $ehof_preservation_sphere$ was the origin of the $ehof_epcs$, something which would be really fatal, due to us being now unable to reveal the true purpose of the $ehof_ep$. Fortunately, our scientists are convinced that $ehof_preservation_sphere$ was not the origin of the $ehof_ep$, mostly due to the fact that amplifier objects and the $PGATE_GALACTICS$ did not react to its destruction in the slightest way. This could obviously be a mistake and it could have been the origin.\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, we'll need to complete the $ehof_eps$ Master Code Sequence to create a connection to the origin of the $ehof_ep$ via an $PGATE_GALACTIC$.\n\nThen we'll find reveal its purpose and might also find out what $ehof_preservation_sphere$ had to do with all this."

Besides its similarities to gateways, another surprising connection can be drawn. It appears to be somehow similar to the objects inside the $ehof_cohesive$ systems, which we call $PGATE_GALACTICS$.\n\nIt is entirely possible that this gateway is an activated $PGATE_GALACTIC$. If this proves to be true, it would also mean that the Creators of $ehof_the_compound$, the $ehof_the_stellar_annihilator$ and $ehof_preservation_sphere$, are also the creators of the $PGATE_GALACTICS$, which would be an astonishing revelation!
