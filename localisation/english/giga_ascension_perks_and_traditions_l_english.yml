  ap_slice_of_life_desc:0 "Ringworlds, once viewed as the pinnacle of megaengineering, are now little more than glorified habitats. We therefore must move onto the next step of megaengineering by designing a new type of habitat that outclasses even the largest of ringworlds. The $name_alderson$, a gigantic solar system-sized disk built around a star, would allow us to house an unimaginable quantity of people and industry."
  add_research_options_alderson:0 "Research options gained:\n£engineering_research£§YThe $name_alderson$§!"

  ap_systemcraft:0 "Esoteric Celestial Weaponization"
  ap_systemcraft_desc:0 "We are already able to transform entire planets into warships, but some of our more ambitious scientists believe that it might be possible to, somehow, go even bigger. An entire solar system, assembled together to form a warship of unbelievably huge proportions. This grand construct would dwarf even the mighty $name_war_planet$, and last, we might finally have enough dakka."
  add_research_options_systemcraft_base:0 "Research options gained:\n£physics_research£§YFramework: Stellarscale Propulsion§!\nWe will begin to work on a series of technologies to eventually construct the largest and grandest vessel this galaxy, or perhaps even universe, has ever seen."

  ap_vast_expanses:0 "Vast Expanses"
  ap_vast_expanses_desc:0 "Our ever expanding needs for habitation and production have reached a point at which we have to dedicate ourselves to the creation of the ultimate living space. For that we need to fully utilize the largest objects in the galaxy to their maximum potential.\n\nAllows an $ehof_ehofp4$ to find an §BInactive Supermassive Black Hole§! if our galaxy core is not one."
  add_research_options_birch_world:0 "Research options gained:\n£engineering_research£§Y$name_birch$§!\nThe $name_birch$ is a massive habitat built around the largest of black holes intended for permanent and eternal residence of a species. It starts as a barren metal sphere with a single district, but gains more district slots as its population grows and expands on the shell's surface, thus making it able to house an infinite amount of pops."

  ap_gigastructural_constructs:0 "Gigastructural Constructs"
  ap_gigastructural_constructs_desc:0 "Bigger is always better. By constructing megastructures of unthinkable size and scope, we can secure our place as a galactic hyperpower."

  ap_qso:0 "A Weapon to Pierce the Heavens"
  ap_qso_desc:0 "The discovery of an hyperenergetic quasar at the galactic core represents an incredible opportunity to construct a weapon that would dwarf even the $name_ndb$, or the Systemcraft. A weapon of such sheer size and scale that it would wield destructive power several orders of magnitudes higher than anything built before. A weapon, that would shatter the very heavens themselves.\n\nAllows an $ehof_ehofp4$ to find an §BActive Supermassive Quasar§! if our galaxy core is not one."
  add_research_options_quasistellar_base:0 "Research options gained:\n£physics_research£§YFramework: Hyperdimensional Shielding§!\nWe will embark on a quest to assemble the §R$name_quasistellar$§!, a gigantic gun, built around the galactic core, of such overwhelming power that nothing could possibly resist its sheer fury.\n\n§RUndertaking the construction of such a deadly weapon will undoubtedly anger the galaxy as a whole.§!"

  ap_celestial_printing:0 "Celestial Warship Assembly"
  ap_celestial_printing_desc:0 "Attack Moons and Behemoth Planetcrafts far outshine all other vessels, both in terms of size, firepower, and defensive capabilities. Even the mighty Titans, Colossi, and Star-Eaters are nothing compared to even a single Attack Moon. Unfortunately, they must be built on particular celestial bodies that meet specific criteria, which drastically limits our ability to produce them. But why limit ourselves? With our current technological base, displacing large amounts of raw matter from a planet to a specialized megastructure would be trivial. By doing so, we could effectively create humongous megastructural devices which, when fed raw planetary matter harvested from various celestial bodies, would be capable of "printing" out Attack Moons with relative ease. It is time that we fully embrace this possibility and begin the mass-production of weaponized planetoids, and finally do away with the puny and pathetic vessels of old!"

  ap_planetcraft_primacy:0 "Planetcraft Primacy"
  ap_planetcraft_primacy_desc:0 "Considering our mastery over the artificial assembly of Celestial Warship, why should we continue to bother with the ridiculously small and weak warships employed by the rest of the galaxy? Instead, we will now focus entirely on assembling a grand armada of weaponized celestial bodies, so that the galaxy itself may fight for us! Some may say it is insanity or madness, but we call it ambition."

  tr_macroengineering_skyhooks_delayed:0 "Why employ complicated solutions when much simpler ones exist? Skyhooks are a relatively cheap and low-tech method of transporting a payload between different celestial bodies without the need for advanced technologies, based entirely on the transfer of kinetic energy. They can be used to sustain the development of newly-created colonies before more permanent infrastructure is established."

Everything from waste heat to biological byproducts can be recycled and refined into something useful, even if it is not necessarily apparent. Designing self-sustaining systems capable of functioning off their own waste is an important step in establishing our dominance over the cosmos."
