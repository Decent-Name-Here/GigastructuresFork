  # Abstract Physics Theory
  tech_abstract_1:0 "Abstract Physics Theory"
  tech_abstract_1_desc:0 "Some exotic physical phenomenons may not be explainable with quantum-theoretical or string-theoretical approaches alone. A new branch of physics called 'Abstract Physics', which makes use of extremely unconventional mathematical and physical methods and approaches, may lead to the answers for even the most absurd phenomenons of the universe and beyond."

  # Applied Abstract Physics
  tech_abstract_2:0 "Applied Abstract Physics"
  tech_abstract_2_desc:0 "The extremely efficient approaches of Abstract Physics are aiding us well in explaining even the universe's most abstract phenomenons.

  # Quoudroplean Formalism
  tech_abstract_3:0 "Quoudroplean Formalism"
  tech_abstract_3_desc:0 "With Abstract Physics being very different to other branches of physics, it is in need of its own customized and adapted kind of mathematical formalism. The 'Quoudroplean Formalism' makes use of alternative and bizarre mathematical frameworks and theorems, which don't fit into the classical universe of mathematics and have been thought to be entirely inapplicable and inadequate for reality analyzes and studies."

  # Non-paradoxical Information Supercausality

Only processes in which no information gets transmitted or the bending of spacetime, can allow for apparent faster than the speed of causality travel. However, in Abstract Physics, the boundaries between what is a fixed rule and what not are fluid and shifting. There are certain ways to work around these rules, change them or even simply ignore them. As absurd as it may appear."
